				<h1>Welcome</h1>
				<p>Multiparty Computation is a field of Computer Science that allows a group of people to each individually keep their data secret, while cooperatively calculating information about that data. It is an extremely useful process that has applications for voting, auctions, better privacy on the web, and dozens of other measures that we currently do non-optimally. Despite this usability, the field remains underused and esoteric. Within these pages, we hope to explain to researchers, students, enthusiasts, and anyone else interested, what multiparty computation is, how it can be useful, and what they can do to help. To get started, follow a link below, or mouse over the dark green line above to open the menu.</p>
				<p>This site is still under construction. The tutorial section and next steps section are both only placeholders; the research section is where the huge majority of the content is present.</p>

					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
					<p>This site was carefully built to be accessible by people from any level of background in Computer Science or Cryptography. Find below wherever you think would be best to start:</p>
					<h3>Beginners</h3>
					<p>There is a comprehensive <a href="learn.html">tutorial section</a> built just for people who have never really dealt with Cryptography before.</p>
					<h3>Students</h3>
					<p>The <a href="learn.html">tutorial section</a> contains a large amount of information, including examples and code samples. If you need to dive further in depth, use the citations or go directly to the <a href="research.html">research section</a> in order to find more advanced topics.</p>
					<h3>Companies</h3>
					<p>If you're looking for an implementation or for an idea of how Multiparty Computation can help you or your business, the <a href="nextsteps.html">example library</a> is a great place to start.</p>
					<h3>Researchers</h3>
					<p>Stand on the shoulders of giants by seeing our catalogue of Multiparty Computation research <a href="research.html">here</a>. Further inspiration can be found in the <a href="nextsteps.html">next steps</a> section where we look at what things are yet to be done in the field.</p>
