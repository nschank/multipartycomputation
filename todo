	34.6: Without the assumption that \(C+L=n\), things seem to become more complicated. It is clear that as long as \(L\leq\left\lfloor\frac{(n-1)}{2}\right\rfloor\), then the solution outlined above still works, but without this condition it is not clear what happens. The method with multiplication of polynomials does not work any more, because it leads to polynomials of a degree larger than the number of available shares. Therefore the construction of a general computation protocol under these special assumptions remains an open problem.
