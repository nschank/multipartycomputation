			A set of \(m\) people \(P\) are trying to communicate with each other to evaluate the values of some set of up to \(m\) functions \(F\).
			Each person \(P_i\) is in possession of some private variable \(x_i\). When the communication is done, each person \(P_i\) wants to know the value of \(F_i(x_1,x_2,x_3,\cdots,x_m)\).
			
			The <span class="definable" data-define="security constraint">security constraints</span> and <span class="definable" data-define="privacy constraint">privacy constraints</span> under which
			everyone is operating change problem to problem. Generally, however, every person in \(P\) wants their privacy maintained, in that, they want no other person in P to
			learn the value of their private variable \(x_i\). Additionally, the protocol may guarantee some security: no people <i>not</i> in \(P\)&mdash;or <span class="definable" data-define="adversary">adversaries</span>&mdash;to learn anything at all, or to be
			able to alter the evaluation of any of their functions.
