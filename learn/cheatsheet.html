					<p class="l_content">
						We begin by stressing the difference between the mod <i>function</i>, and modular <i>equivalence</i>. The mod (or remainder) function is defined as \(x\bmod y = r\quad 0\leq r\lt y\) where \(\exists k\in\mathbb Z\) such that \(ky+r=x.\) Generally, \(x,y,r\in\mathbb Z\), though all can meaningfully be extended to \(\mathbb R\). Modular equivalence between two values \(a,b\) with respect to some quotient \(c\) is expressed as \(a\equiv b\pmod c,\) which is equivalent to the statement \(a\bmod c\quad=\quad b\bmod c.\)
					</p>
					<p class="l_content">
						Notice the the former is a function, whereas the latter is a statement of equivalence within a particular relation; the former has a 'solution', the latter is simply a property of \(a,b\). In particular, we stress that \(a\equiv b\pmod c\) does NOT imply \(a=b\bmod c\), though the reverse is true.
					</p>
					<p class="l_content">
						Now, for some major definitions, algorithms, and theorems. \(a,b,c,n,x,y\in\mathbb Z;\;p,q,\in\mathbb P\) (the set of all primes)

						Much of cryptography uses a particular notation for probability that can take some getting used to: <i>experiment notation</i>. A single event is written in the form \(x\leftarrow\mathcal X\), where \(x\) is a variable being sampled from some distribution \(\mathcal X\). We define the probability distribution of a set \(S\) to be the uniform distribution \(\mathcal S\) over that set. We define the probability distribution of some function applied to a variable, as in \(F(x,y)\), to be a probability distribution over the outputs of that function given those inputs. We now define the probability of some predicate p after a series of \(n\) events (in its most general form) as follows: $$\operatorname{Pr}\left[x_1\leftarrow\mathcal X_1;\;x_2\leftarrow\mathcal X_2;\;\dots;\;x_n\leftarrow\mathcal X_n\;:\;\operatorname p(x_1,\dots,x_n)\right].$$
					</p>
					<p class="l_content">
						So, as an example, let's use experiment notation to define the ciphertext indistinguishability of an encryption protocol, then go through it step by step. We define three protocols that make up the encryption scheme: 
						$$\begin{align} \mathcal G: &1^k\;\mapsto\;(\{0,1\}^k,\{0,1\}^k)\\
														&\mathcal G(1^k)=(p_k,s_k)\\
										\mathcal E: &\{0,1\}^k,\{0,1\}^k\;\mapsto\;\{0,1\}^k\\
														&\mathcal E(p_k,m) = c\\
										\mathcal D: &\{0,1\}^k,\{0,1\}^k\;\mapsto\;\{0,1\}^k\\
														&\mathcal D(s_k,c) = m.\end{align}$$
						To define correctness (very quickly and loosely; see the page on <a data-broken-link=true>primitives</a> for a more official definition), we state that, for any pair \(p_k,s_k\) created by \(\mathcal G(1^k),\;\mathcal D\left(s_k,\mathcal E\left(p_k,x\right)\right)=x\) for all \(x\in\{0,1\}^k\). We now define a particular type of security using experiment notation. We call such an encryption scheme <i>ciphertext indistinguishable under chosen plaintext attack</i> if, for all probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms \(\mathcal A\) and for <span class="definable">negligible</span> function \(\operatorname\mu\): $$\operatorname{Pr}\left[(p_k,s_k)\leftarrow\mathcal G(1^k);\; (m_0,m_1,\text{state})\leftarrow\mathcal A(p_k);\; b\leftarrow\{0,1\};\; b'\leftarrow\mathcal A\left(\text{state},\mathcal E(p_k,m_b)\right)\;:\; b=b'\right]\quad\leq\quad\frac12+\operatorname\mu(k).$$ 
					</p>
					<p class="l_content">
						We now present the same experiment (or "game") as an annotated list of the different pieces, with some explanations for choices made in the writing of the expression:
					</p>
					<ol class="l_content">
						<li>\((p_k,s_k)\leftarrow\mathcal G(1^k)\): We (the challenger) use the key generation algorithm to create a key pair.</li>
						<li>\((m_0,m_1,\text{state})\leftarrow\mathcal A(p_k)\): We allow the adversary (algorithm) to generate two messages, \(m_0\) and \(m_1\), and some variable representing the state of the algorithm after its initial run. We provide the algorithm with the public key, which means it is able to try as many (polynomially many) encryptions as it wishes before deciding on specific messages. We do not need to provide the public key again, as the algorithm (without loss of generality) will include it in its state.</li>
						<li>\(b\leftarrow\{0,1\}\): We uniformly at random choose some bit \(b\).</li>
						<li>\(b'\leftarrow\mathcal A\left(\text{state},\mathcal E(p_k,m_b)\right)\): We let the adversary (algorithm) continue by providing it with its state variable, as well as the encryption of \(m_b\) under the public key. We allow it to make a guess (\(b'\)) for which message \(m_{b'}\) was encrypted.</li>
						<li>\(b=b'\): We calculated the probability that, having done all this, the adversary correctly guessed which message we encrypted.</li>
						<li>\(\leq\frac12+\operatorname\mu(k)\): Firstly, we note that we cannot expect the probability to be less than \(\frac12\); guessing at random should produce a probability of \(\frac12\), so we know it will be at least better than that. It is for this exact purpose that <span class="definable">negligible</span> functions are so often used in cryptography: to allow us to define a notion of being <i>barely</i> better (or worse) than some bound. As a thought experiment to demonstrate the need for this extra 'wiggle room', we imagine an adversary which calculates \(k\) encryptions for \(m_0,m_1\), meaning it will definitely be correct if the encryption we give it happens to be equal to any of those calculated encryptions. This is better than guessing, but only negligibly (\(\frac{k}{2^{-k}}\)) so.</li>
