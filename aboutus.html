				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>The Multiparty Computation project is a Brown University project undertaken under the <a href="http://www.brown.edu/academics/college/fellowships/utra/">UTRA program</a> over the summer of 2014. It is currently under development, and any comments, questions, or advice would be welcomed by <a href="mailto:multipartycomputationorg@gmail.com">Nick</a>.

					<p>Professor Savage earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering at MIT in 1965 specializing in coding and information theory. He joined Bell Laboratories in 1965 and the faculty of the Division of Engineering at Brown in 1967. In 1979 he co-founded the Department of Computer Science and served as its second chair from 1985 to 1991. By the early 1970s his research interests changed to theoretical computer science. His current research interests are cybersecurity technology and policy, reliable computation with unreliable components, computational nanotechnology, efficient cache management on multicore chips, and I/O complexity.</p>

					<p>Nick is a rising junior at Brown University concentrating in Computer Science, with a particular focus in Cybersecurity. He decided to undertake this UTRA under Professor Savage's advisement and is working hard to create this website, summarize research, and possibly implement some MPC's if time permits. He hails from Gaithersburg, Maryland and is currently sealed in a cave in Providence, RI, coding.</p>
