					<h1>Alterations To Works</h1>
					<p>Part of the purpose of this website is to make available heavily annotated, HTML versions of research related to multiparty computation. With this goal in mind, many papers are transcribed by hand. Certain changes to these documents were made purposefully, beyond the annotations and extra marking up (e.g. equation explanations). The following cosmetic changes are made consistently during all transcription processes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For consistency, the words 'multi-party' and 'trap-door' are always unhyphenated.</li>
						<li>When using big-oh and related concepts, equality (=) is always replaced by the more conceptually appropriate (and more intuitive) set membership (\(\in\)).</li>
						<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">Serial commas</a> are always added when they do not introduce ambiguity not originally present. When both the presence and absence of a serial comma would (or does) create ambiguity, the sentence is generally rephrased entirely.</li>
						<li>The use of "his" as an ungendered pronoun is replaced by either restructuring the sentence to use "one" or "they", or using "his or her", whichever is subjectively more appealing at the time of transcription.</li>
						<li>Any sentence ambiguity or confusion is subject to rephrasing.</li>
						<li>Any cosmetic typos are fixed without further explanation.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Any non-cosmetic typos and errors&mdash;that is, errors which change the actual meaning of the text in a significant way&mdash;will be altered with a note (generally an annotation) which marks what was changed and why the change was made. If you are the license holder and disagree with one of these changes, <a href="multipartycomputationorg+copyright@gmail.com">contact us</a>. If you are knowledgeable about the topic at hand and disagree with a change, use the email address at the bottom of that page to inform us what change was made, what change should be made instead (including reverting back to the original text), and a detailed explanation of why. Note that we reserve the right to use or not use any explanation you give us about a proposed change, at our discretion.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you find a typo in the original text that was not changed, or you find a typo that we introduced during transcription, feel free to contact us using the email address at the bottom of that page to inform us of the problem.
