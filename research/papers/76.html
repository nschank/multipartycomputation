						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							<b>Verifiable Secret Sharing and Multiparty Protocols with Honest Majority</b> is a 1989 by Tal Rabin and Michael Ben-Or, a combination of two separate papers they were working on, which provides some useful theorems for the powers of an adversary in multiparty computations. It is a culmination of several years in which multiparty computation research was mostly focused on fault tolerance in the face of adversarial behavior, and offers the strongest possible protections a multiparty protocol can offer (as always, under certain assumptions). The assumptions made are all related to networks and to the adversary, not to computational intractability, so the secrecy offered is <span class="load-definable" data-define="information-theoretic security">information-theoretic</span>.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							This paper's main results relate to how <span class="load-definable" data-define="broadcast channel">broadcast channels</span> affect the tolerability of adversary structures. Since verifiable secret sharing is a primitive used by essentially all multiparty computation protocols presented before, the authors using broadcast as a primitive allows an honest majority to achieve information theoretic security, but requires an exponentially small error probability for \(n/3\leq t\lt n/2\) <span class="load-definable" data-define="malicious party">faulty players</span>. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section id="goals" data-section-name="Goals and Results">
						<h2>Goals and Results</h2>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							The authors intended to demonstrate the most possible effective form of multiparty computation in the face of the strongest adversary which can be dealt with (in the general case). Specifically, the authors played with the idea of a <span class="load-definable">broadcast channel</span>, and demonstrated how assuming the presence of a broadcast channel extends the capabilities of verifiable secret sharing schemes (and therefore multiparty computation).
						</p>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							In a complete network, assuming the existence of a broadcast channel, information-theoretically secure verifiable secret sharing is achievable for \(t\lt n/2\) <span class="load-definable" data-define="malicious party">faulty players</span>. However, for \(n/3\leq t\lt n/2\), it is not possible to avoid an exponentially small probability of error. As a result, <b>honest majority is sufficient to provide information-theoretically secure multiparty computation with a <span class="load-definable">negligible</span> probability of error.</b>
						</p>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							In an incomplete network, assuming \(2t+1\)-<span class="load-definable">connectivity</span>, and without a broadcast channel, information-theoretically secure verifiable secret sharing is achievable for \(t\lt n/3\) faulty players, with no probability of error. 
						</p>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							We note that, as mentioned in some other papers for completeness, in the general case \(t=n/3\) (or \(t=n/2\) with broadcast) does not necessarily offer information-theoretic security.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							The essential technique of this paper is a threshold verified secret-sharing technique similar to the one presented several times in the years previous (using Galois Fields and polynomial sharing), with an additional "weak secret sharing" technique that allows easier transitioning between sub-shares and top-level shares. The Weak Secret Sharing technique uses specially created <i>check vectors</i>, independently selected values which allows a recipient to be sure that a share broadcasted by a player was the one given to that player by the dealer. Very simply put, if the dealer wants to commit player \(P_i\) to the share \(s\) in a field \(\mathbb F\), the dealer gives the player \((s,y)\) (with \(y\) being any random value in \(\mathbb F\)), and gives the player who will later receive that value \((b,c),\;b,x\in\mathbb F,\;s+by=c\). When \(P_i\) wants to release the share, \(P_i\) has an exponentially low probability of lying about \(s\) successfully, since if \(s'+by'\neq c\) for released share \((s',y')\), then the receiving player will reject it.

								Comparing the recent unconditional results on multiparty protocols of Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Widgerson<sup class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</sup> and of Chaum, Cr&eacute;peau, and Damg&aring;rd<sup class="reference" data-citation="CCD">[?]</sup>, to the previous cryptographic results of Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson<sup class="reference" data-citation="GMW">[?]</sup>, based on the existence of secure trapdoor functions, we find the following: On the one hand, the cryptographic results are stronger since they require only a majority of the \(n\) participating players to be honest, while the unconditional results require that more than \(\frac{2n}3\) of the players be honest. One the other hand, the unconditional results are both simpler and stronger since their security is "<span class="load-definable" data-define="information theoretic security">Information Theoretic</span>" and does not depend on any assumptions about computational intractability. Moreover, the results of <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span> with up to \(t\not\leq\lt\frac n 3\) faulty players guarantee absolute correctness of the results, and do not allow even an exponentially small probability of error. Such exponentially small errors are inherent to any cryptographic result based on trapdoor functions.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								Note the above correction; Ben-Or et al.'s results specifically demonstrate that \(n/3\) is not always possible, as can be seen by their <a href="17.html#theorem4">Theorem 4</a>.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The one third limit on the number of unreliable participants in the unconditional results mentioned above is necessary since otherwise even Byzantine agreement is impossible. It is natural to ask, however, what can be done if we ensure agreement by assuming the existence of a <span class="load-definable">broadcast channel</span>? Likewise, by <span class="reference" data-citation="D">[?]</span>, Byzantine agreement is still possible in incomplete networks with \(2t+1\) connectibity and we can ask what multiparty protocols can be achieved under these conditions.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								To understand why a broadcast channel doesn't seem to help that much, we note a theorem of <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span> stating that the absolutely errorless results <i>cannot</i> be extended to tolerate \(t\geq\frac n 3\) faulty players even with a broadcast channel. Moreover, as stated informally in <span class="reference" data-citation="CCD">[?]</span>, the broadcast channel does not allow an absolutely errorless solution even to the Verifiable Secret Sharing problem (VSS) with \(t\geq\frac n 3\) faulty players. We formally prove here that any solution must allow some error probability \(\epsilon\gt0\), though \(\epsilon\) may be only exponentially small (deleted from this extended abstract). Since the VSS protocol is an essential component of any secure multiparty protocol these negative results led many researchers to conjecture that some cryptographic assumptions are indeed needed to handle \(t\) faulty players for \(\frac n 3\leq t\lt\frac n 2\), even with a broadcast channel.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								In a similar way, the VSS protocols of <span class="reference" data-citation="CCD">[?]</span> and <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span> were used by Feldman and Micali<sup class="reference" data-citation="FM">[?]</sup> and Feldman<sup class="reference" data-citation="F">[?]</sup> to achieve constant expected time non-cryptographic Byzantine agreement protocols in the <span class="load-definable" data-define="synchronous network">synchronous</span> and asynchronous cases respectively. Here again there are some intriguing gaps. In the synchronous case assuming a complete communication network, the protocols of <span class="reference" data-citation="FM">[?]</span> can tolerate up to \(t\lt\frac n 3\) faulty players, but leave the general network case to cryptographic protocols. In the asynchronous case the non-cryptographic solution of <span class="reference" data-citation="F">[?]</span> allows only \(t\lt\frac n4\) faulty players and relies on cryptographic VSS protocols to handle up to \(t\lt\frac n3\) faults. Feldman has also raised the conjecture that \(t\lt\frac n4\) is the limit for any unconditional asynchronous VSS protocol.

								The main results of this paper close most of these gaps. We show

							<span class="rp_theorem_header">Main Theorem</span>
							<p class="rp_original rp_theorem">
								Assuming the existence of a <span class="load-definable">broadcast channel</span> and private communication channels between each pair of \(n\) players, there exists a (poly-time) Verifiable Secret Sharing protocol tolerating up to \(t\lt\frac n2\) fault players. The secrecy achieved is unconditional, and the probability of error is exponentially small.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								A new and very practical idea of <i>Information Checking</i> is introduced in this paper. Information Checking is what enables our solution, and it may have wide applications elsewhere. It is a non-cryptographic weaker version of Digital Signatures. Weaker in the sense that not all securities provided by Digital Signatures are supplied by Information Checking, but it gives exactly the right amount of authentication power we need.

							<p class="rp_original">
								As a simple application of our information checking technique we show, (Compare Tompa and Woll <span class="reference" data-citation="TW">[?]</span>),

							<p class="rp_original rp_theorem">
								Let \(n\geq2t+1\).

							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We mention some further applications of these results to incomplete communication networks (without broadcast capability). Let \(G\) be a <span class="load-definable" data-define="synchronous network">synchronous communication network</span> of \(d\) processors. In <span class="reference" data-citation="D">[?]</span>, Dolev established necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-cryptographic Byzantine Agreement protocols tolerating up to \(t\) Byzantine faults on G. Namely, that \(n\geq3t+1\), and that the connectivity of \(G\) is at least \(2t+1\). The following theorem extends the fast Byzantine agreement protocols of <span class="reference" data-citation="FM">[?]</span> to incomplete synchronous networks satisfying Dolev's conditions.

							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">

							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Our main theorem on VSS using the broadcast channel provides the necessary building block for general multiparty protocols under the same conditions. The next theorem provides the most important application of the main theorem, and it provides a strictly stronger result than the previous cryptographic results.

							<span class="rp_theorem_header">Theorem 4</span>
							<p class="rp_original rp_theorem">
								Assuming that each participant can broadcast a message to all other participants and that each pair of participants can communicate secretly, any multiparty protocol, or game with incomplete information, can be achieved if a majority of the players are honest.

							<span class="rp_sub_header">Remark:</span>
							<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
								It is important to note that Theorem 4 only guarantees that a set of up to \(t\lt\frac n2\) fault players cannot gain any additional information or disrupt the computation. As in all the previous results, it cannot prevent the bad players from sending all the information they are holding to some honest player. Likewise, if among three players one of the players is faulty and stops sending messages, no further secrecy conditions are imposed on the other two honest players left. Therefore, they can exchange all their input information between them and complete the computation. This last example may seem quite puzzling. It is therefore natural to add to the requirements on our protocols that any honest player alone will not hold any additional information (not following from the information in that player's hands together with the fault players). This last condition can easily be guaranteed if \(n\gt2(t+1)+1\) by protecting our computation from coalitions of size \(t+1\) instead of \(t\).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Our results demonstrate the importance of the "Information Checking" idea and we expect this idea to have wide applications. One such possible application is a &frac13;-resilient non-cryptographic Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement protocol. Using our information checking we can present such a solution only under a weaker model of adversary, leaving this important question open.

								<h3>1.1. The Model of Computation</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									In our model of computation we assume a complete <span class="load-definable">synchronous network</span> together with a <span class="load-definable">broadcast channel</span>. The pairwise communication channels between participants are secure, that is, they cannot be <span class="load-definable" data-define="secrecy network">read</span> or <span class="load-definable" data-define="authenticated network">tampered with</span> by other participants. The broadcast channel enables each participant to send the same message to all participants: it identifies the sender, and it is completely reliable. In particular, if any participant receives a message via the broadcast channel all other players will receive the same message.

								<p class="rp_original">
									We assume two types of players: <i>knights</i>&mdash;honest players or dealers who do not disclose any of the information in their hands, and follow all protocols&mdash;and <i>knaves</i>&mdash;fault players or dealers who do as they wish. Knaves may pass incorrect information, or decide to withhold. It is also assumed that all knaves may collaborate and pool their information together. Knaves may have unlimited computing capabilities.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We postulate a <i>dynamic adversary</i> who, at any time during a protocol, and having seen all public may choose which additional players will turn into knaves. The total number of players who are knaves is bounded by \(t\). In addition, the dealer may also be a knave.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									The dynamic adversary concept is codified in the literature as an <i>adaptive adversary</i> a few years later.

									We choose a security parameter \(k\), so that \(2^{-k}\) is deemed a small enough error margin for our needs. Our protocols will be randomized in the sense that no matter what the adversary and the knaves will do, the probability of an error, i.e. improper outcome, will be smaller than \(2^{-k}\). All of our protocols and algorithms will be polynomial in the number of players \(n\), and in \(k\).

								<h3>1.2. The Information Checking Protocol</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We now proceed to describe a simple process, which will be used later on to solve the Verifiable Secret Sharing Problem. This process enables us to carry out authentication of information. It is not as powerful as Digital Signatures, but on the other hand it needs no cryptographic assumptions.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									There are 3 participants in the process: (1) \(D\), a dealer, who holds a datum \(s\), (2) \(INT\), an intermediary, who is to receive \(s\) from \(D\), and who at a later time may wish to pass it on to (3) \(R\), the recipient. The player \(R\) is said to <i>accept</i> \(s\), if that player believes that this value originated with \(D\). We wish that the protocol of acceptance will have the following properties:
								</p>
								<ol class="rp_original">
									<li>If \(D\) and \(R\) are knights, then \(R\) will always accept \(s\) if it actually originated with \(D\), and will reject with probability \(\geq 1-\frac1{2^k}\) any other value \(s'\).</li>
									<li>Regardless if \(D\) is a knight or a knave, \(INT\) will know, with probability of mistake \(\leq\frac1{2^k}\), whether \(R\) will accept the \(s\) that \(INT\) holds.</li>
								</ol>
								<p class="rp_original">
									For this, a new tool called <i>Information Checking</i> is proposed. Information Checking has two major parts called (1) <i>check vectors</i> (2) <i>verification of check vectors</i>.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Information Checking is carried out by the three participants in the following way: We assume that a large enough prime, \(p\gt2^k\), has been decided upon for all the computations. Without loss of generality \(s\in\mathbb{Z}_p\).

									<h4>1.2.1. Check Vectors</h4>

										The dealer \(D\) chooses two random numbers \(b\neq0\) and \(y\) both in \(\mathbb Z_p\), and hands to \(INT\) the pair \((s,y)\). The dealer \(D\) computes \(s+by=c\). Then the dealer hands to \(R\) the vector \((b,c)\) which will be known as the <i>Check Vector</i>.
									</p>

										Later, when \(INT\) will transmit \((s,y)\) to the receiver \(R\), the receiver will compute \(s+by\) and will accept only if it equals \(c\).

									<span class="rp_sub_header">Proof of Lemma 1:</span>
									<ol class="rp_original rp_sub">
										<li>If \(INT\) chooses a new value \(s'\) to force \(R\) to accept, \(INT\) must find the \(y'\) which will solve the equation $$s'+by'=c.$$ Only one \(y'\) will solve the equation for the \(b\) held in \(R\)'s hand. Thus the probability $$\operatorname{Pr}\left[R\text{ will accept }s'\neq s\,\middle|\,D\text{ is a knight}\right]\;=\;\frac1{p-1}.$$</li>
										<li>The receiver \(R\), has no information about \(s\) from the check vector the dealer gave because all values of \(s\) are still possible, with equal probability, due to the fact that for each \(s\) there is a single \(y\) which satisfies the equation.</li>
									</ol>
									<span class="rp_sub_header">Remark</span>
									<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
										Information checking immediately generalizes to the case of several receivers. Let us assume the case where there is one dealer \(D\), one intermediary \(INT\), and receivers \(R_1,\dots,R_n\). The dealer hands to \(INT\) the secret \(s\) and random values \(y_1,\dots,y_n\). \(y_i\) will eventually be handed to \(R_i\) to authenticate \(s\). Each \(R_i\) receives from \(D\) a check vector \((b_i,c_i)\), created in the way described above. Even if all \(R_i\)'s pool their data together, they still have no information about the secret, and for the intermediary who holds the \(y_i\)'s the probability of deceiving one of the players is \(\frac1{p-1}\).

										To secure property 2 we use the "zero-knowledge" proof technique of <span class="reference" data-citation="R2">[?]</span>.

For each one of these check vectors, \(INT\) computes $$s+b_{d_i}y_{d_i}=c_{d_i}.$$ If <i>all</i> \(k\) check vectors satisfy the equation, then \(INT\) concludes that \(R\) will accept the value \(s\) that \(INT\) holds. Otherwise \(INT\) concludes that \(R\) will reject this value.

									<p class="rp_original">
										We stipulate that \(R\) will accept a value \(s\) handed over to him or her by \(INT\), if <i>any one</i> of the <i>unrevealed</i> check vectors, which \(R\) holds for \(s\), satisfy the necessary equation.

									<span class="rp_sub_header">Proof of Lemma 2:</span>
									<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
										If the dealer is a knight then \(R\) will never reject \(s\). In order for the error stated in the Lemma to occur, it must be that \(INT\) has received \(k\) check vectors which are good and \(R\) holds \(k\) unrevealed check vectors which are all faulty. Thus, the probability that \(INT\) will choose all the \(k\) good check vectors is: $$\operatorname{Pr}\left[I\text{ assumes }R\text{ will accept }s\,\middle|\,R\text{ rejects }s\right]\;\leq\;\binom{2k}{k}^{-1}$$ Thus using the protocol of Information Checking as a primitive, we achieve the required 1 and 2.

The player \(P_i\) is to be the intermediary as defined in the Information Checking Protocol, and \(P_j\) will be the receiver. The dealer is the dealer who shared the secret. \(P_i\) wants to verify the check vectors held by all other players for the piece \(\beta_i\). The modification is that if \(P_i\) is not satisfied that all players will accept this piece, \(P_i\) will take measures to ensure that they will.

										<li>The dealer may: (1) broadcast an approval of these check vectors, or (2) created a new check vector for \(\beta_i\) in the usual manner, hand over to the intermediary \(P_i\) the number \(y_{ij}\), and <i>broadcast</i> \((b_{ij},c_{ij})\).

If \(P_i\) decided that \(P_j\) will reject \(\beta_i\), he or she broadcasts a request that the dealer \(D\) broadcast \(P_i\)'s piece on the graph \(f(x)\). After \(P_i\)'s piece has been broadcasted, \(P_i\) will stop the verification of check vectors. If the second instance in 3 has occurred, \(P_i\) checks the single check vector, broadcasted by the dealer, and according to the result takes the same measures as defined before.</li>

										Data unknown to knaves is data which is transferred between knights. If the dealer exposes \(P_j\)'s check vectors it is because \(D\) and/or \(P_j\) are knaves, otherwise \(D\) will be content with what \(P_j\) had broadcasted. If \(INT\) is a knight and requests the disclosure of his or her own piece, then it must be that \(D\) is a knave. This is because the dealer has the last say about the check vectors and if, after that, they are still faulty, then \(D\) must be a knave&mdash;so the information broadcasted is the dealer's information which is already known to the knaves.

									<span class="rp_sub_header">Remark</span>
									<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
										The above verification scheme assures a knight \(P_i\), acting as intermediary, that the piece \(\beta_i\) will be accepted by \(P_j\), the receiver, or that the piece associated with \(P_i\) has been made public by the dealer during the process.
									</p>
									<p class="rp_original">
										It is not important if the piece \(\gamma_i\) exposed by \(D\) differs from \(\beta_i\), the piece held by \(P_i\), because \(\gamma_i\) is now a value to which \(D\) has <span class="load-definable" data-define="commitment">committed</span> as being \(P_i\)'s point on the graph \(f(x)\).

								<h3>5.1. Error Free Transmission</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Assume \(D\) and \(R\) are \(2t+1\) connected, and \(D\) wants to transmit the message \(M\) to \(R\). \(D\) randomly writes \(M=M_1+M_2\), and sends using the scheme described above \(M_1\) to \(R.\;R\) collects all the verified messages (i.e. at least \(t+1\) verifications) and, if there is a polynomial of degree \(t\) that <span class="load-definable" data-define="interpolation">interpolates</span> through <i>all</i> the points, \(R\) takes the free coefficient as \(M_1\). In this case \(R\) <span class="load-definable" data-define="broadcast channel">broadcasts</span> an acknowledgement on all the \(2t+1\) lines to \(D\), and \(D\) tries to send \(M_2\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									On the other hand, if \(R\) cannot complete the interpolation through all the points, \(R\) broadcasts back to \(D\) (along the \(2t+1\) lines) all the information received from all lines. This step does not relay any information because this will be done either for \(M_1\) or for \(M_2\) but never for both, and clearly \(M_1 (M_2)\) alone contains no information.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									At this stage, \(D\) compares the broadcast of \(R\) to its original messages. \(D\) marks all the mismatches as "bad", and broadcasts the "bad" list to \(R\). Concurrently, \(D\) breaks up the message \(M\) into new random pieces \(M=N_1+N_2\), and begins the whole procedure again, but now \(R\) will ignore the shares of the secret coming from connections on the bad list.

Moreover, because of the check vectors, only with exponentially small probability will there be any need for retransmission.

								<h3>5.2. Note</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									The procedure described above, without the check vectors, is only a slight variation of the transmission scheme of <span class="reference" data-citation="DDY">[?]</span>. It is clear that this procedure works as well without the check vectors, but there is a clear advantage in using the check vectors during this procedure. Without the check vectors, the \(t\) bad players can cause a delay of \(O(t\cdot d)\) steps in the communication between good players, whereas using the check vectors, only with exponentially small probability will there be any need for retransmission.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									It is clear that if \(D\) and \(R\) are both good, the expected number of communication rounds to get an error free transmission is a constant (\(O(d)\)). A slightly more complicated problem is to handle the case of a bad \(D\) sending a message to a good \(R\). In this case using the scheme described above, the bad \(D\) can easily cause a delay of \(O(td)\) time until \(R\) will be able to continue. Thus, unless we are willing to give up the synchrony of our simulated protocol a single bad player can cause a delay of \(O(td)\) steps.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									To avoid this problem, we make \(D\) the dealer of the secret in our VSS protocol. Assuming \(R\) is good we get a <span class="load-definable">broadcast channel</span> simulation between all the \(2t+1\) connections and the dealer \(D\) as follows:
								</p>
								<ul class="rp_original">
									<li>A broadcast of one of the \(2t+1\) is sent to \(R\) who sends it on all \(2t+1\) connections, and they transmit the message also to \(D\) (who gets the message by a simple majority rule).</li>
									<li>A broadcast from \(D\) to all the players is done by having \(D\) send the message on all lines to \(R\). \(R\) gets the message (by majority), and sends the value received to all the \(2t+1\) connections. This value coming from \(R\) is taken as the value of \(D\)'s broadcast.</li>
									<li>The private line between two connections can go through \(R\).</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Since the VSS uses a constant number of rounds, so will this simulation. Since the VSS guarantees with exponentially small probability of error that there will be a \(t\)-degree polynomial interpolating through all the accepted points, \(R\) will get a message (or realize that \(D\) is faulty) in constant number of rounds with only an exponentially small probability of not being able to decide what happened. In this case we can go back to the previous scheme, and continue for at most \(O(t)\) more rounds. Since this happens only with exponentially small probability, we get an \(O(d)\) expected time transmission even from a bad \(D\) to a good \(R\). (The case of faulty \(R\) and good \(D\) is not needed at all).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									From this constant expected time error-free transmission we can prove a stronger version of Theorem 3.
								</p>
								<span class="rp_theorem_header" id="theorem3star">Theorem 3*</span>
								<p class="rp_original rp_theorem">
									Let \(G\) be a <span class="load-definable">synchronous network</span> of \(n\geq3t+1\) processors, with <span class="load-definable">connectivity</span> at least \(2t+1\), and <span class="load-definable" data-define="diameter of a graph">diameter</span> \(d=d(G)\), that provides private and secure communication links between processors that are directly connected by \(G\), then any multiparty protocol \(\mathcal P\) can be achieved on \(G\) if at most \(t\) of the players are faulty. As in <span class="reference" data-citation="DDY">[?]</span>, the computation is completely error-free, and the secrecy achieved is unconditional. Moreover, the expected computation time is only \(\operatorname O(d)\) times the best secure and error-free protocol for \(\mathcal P\) on a complete network.

							<p class="rp_annotation rp_theorem">
								Assuming that each participant can broadcast a message to all other participants and that each pair of participants can communicate secretly, any multiparty protocol, or game with incomplete information, can be achieved if a majority of the players are honest.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								Theorem 4 is restated above as it is proven below.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								In this section, all computations are carried out in a small finite field, for example \(\mathbb Z_p\) where \(n\lt p\lt2n\). Our VSS protocol can be easily modified to work in a small finite field or by using a separate large prime for the check vectors.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We say that a group of players \(P_1,\dots,P_n\) <i>will have computed a function \(f(u_1,\dots,u_m)=u\) by a protocol \(PR\)</i>, where \(u_1,\dots,u_m\) were entered into the computation using VSS, if, at the end of the protocol, \(u\) is a verified shared secret.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The problem of multiparty computations can be reduced (see <span class="reference" data-citation="GMW">[?]</span>) to the problem of multiparty function computations. We will produce protocols for addition and multiplication of shared secrets and for multiplication by a publicly known constant, which can be carried out in a fault-tolerant and secrecy-preserving manner. Thus we achieve that a group of \(n\) players can secretly and with fault tolerance compute any function.
							</p>
							<span class="rp_definition_header" id="def3">Definition 3</span>
							<p class="rp_original rp_definition">

								<li>The polynomial \(f(x)\) is of degree \(t\).</li>

								Now, all we need to show in order to prove Theorem 4, is that we can produce protocols for addition and multiplication of verifiable shared secrets \(u\) and \(v\), which maintain the situation that all data in the computation, including the end result, is verified data.
							</p>

									The polynomial \(f^u(x)+f^v(x)=f^{u+v}(x)\) has as its constant term the desired value \(u+v\), and this polynomial is of degree \(t\). If each \(P_i\) adds the known pieces \(\beta_i^u+\beta_i^v=\beta_i^{u+v}\), then \(P_i\) will have a share of \(u+v\) by the polynomial \(f^{u+v}(x)\). Therefore, conditions 1 and 2 for a <span class="load-definable">verified secret</span> hold immediately.

								<p class="rp_original">
									To achieve condition 3, we need that \(\beta_i^{u+v}\) will be shared using WSS.

									Before we proceed to show how to compute the product of two <span class="load-definable" data-define="verified secret">verified secrets</span>, let us prove two lemmas which will be needed later.
								</p>
								<span class="rp_theorem_header" id="lemma9">Lemma 9</span>
								<p class="rp_original rp_theorem">
									A dealer can prove that two secrets, \(s_1\) and \(s_2\), which the dealer shared using VSS, are equal.
								</p>
								<span class="rp_sub_header">Proof</span>
								<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
									All players carry out the subtraction protocol for \(s_1\) and \(s_2\). Based on the lemma for addition/subtraction, this new value is a verified secret, and can be reconstructed by the players. They reconstruct the value \(s_1-s_2\). Now, \(s_1-s_2=0\) iff \(s_1=s_2\).
								</p>
								<span class="rp_theorem_header" id="lemma10">Lemma 10</span>
								<p class="rp_original rp_theorem">
									Using the Zero Knowledge technique the dealer can prove that three secrets \(a,\,b\), and \(c\), satisfy \(a\cdot b=c\).
								</p>
								<span class="rp_sub_header">Proof</span>
								<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
									Let \(f,\,g\), and \(h\) be the polynomials used to distribute \(a,\,b\), and \(c\) respectively. We recall that all our secrets are elements of a small finite field \(E,\,|E|=p\), and we can pick \(p\) to satisfy \(n\lt p\lt2n\). Let \(Z=\{(x,y,z)\,|\,xy=z,\,\forall\,x,y\in E\}\) be the multiplication table of \(E\). The dealer randomly permutes the members of \(Z\) to a list \(\{(x_i,y_i,z_i)\}\). The dealer then generates random polynomials of degree \(t,\,f_i,\,g_i\) and \(h_i,\,i=1\dots p^2\), encoding this list, (e.g. \(f_i(0)=x_i\), etc.). The dealer prepares \(m=knp^2\) independent encoded copies of the multiplication table of \(E\) and distributes all the randomly chosen triples in these lists using our secret sharing protocol. At this point each player broadcasts a list of \(kp^2\) requests asking the dealer to either open completely one of the encoded lists or to show, using the equality protocol of Lemma 9, that for some \(i\) on the list \(f(0)-f_i(0),\, g(0)=g_i(0)\), and \(h(0)=h_i(0)\). It is easy to see that this procedure provides a zero knowledge proof to the fact that \(h(0)=f(0)g(0)\), with probability of failure at most \(2^{-k}\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We now proceed to exhibit the multiplication protocol. For the above \(u\) and \(v\), we would like to compute \(u*v\), and to ensure that the product will be a <span class="load-definable">verified secret</span>.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									The polynomial \(f^u(x)*f^v(x)=f^{u*v}_1(x)\) has as its constant term the desired value \(u*v\), but two problems arise: (1) The polynomial is of degree \(2t\). (2) It is not a random polynomial. To overcome these problems, we will adapt the methods described in <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span>, and in combination with the VSS protocol, we will return to the state in which all data in the computation is verified data. The protocol is as follows:
								</p>
								<ol class="rp_original">
									<li>
										<p>The player \(P_i\) must extend the WSS of \(\beta_i^u\) and \(\beta_i^v\) to VSS. This is easily done: (the protocol given is for \(\beta^u_i\), and the same is done for \(\beta^v_i\))</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Each \(P_j\) holds a piece \(\beta^u_{ij}\) which is a share of \(P_i\text{'s}\,\beta_i^u.\,P_i\) shares \(\beta_{ij}^u\) using WSS</li>
											<li>Then \(P_i\) carries out the zero knowledge proof, as in our VSS protocol, to show that all shares held by the players lie on a polynomial \(h_i^u(x)\) of degree \(t\).</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>If some player refuses to cooperate, or is disqualified in the above process, then that player's pieces are reconstructed by the other players, and become common knowledge. The players which participate in this computation are players who have extended their WSS to VSS; that is, they were not disqualified. Thus, their pieces \(\beta_j^u\), which are now shared by VSS, are points on the graph of the polynomial of the shared secret \(u\). Assume that \(P_i\) didn't follow the protocol: that player's piece \(\beta_i^u\) is computed in the following way:</p>
										<p>Since \(\beta^u_i\) is on a polynomial of degree \(t\), we can represent \(\beta^u_i\) as a linear combination with publicly known (and easily computable) coefficients of any other \(t+1\) point on this polynomial. Since at least \(t+1\) players will extend the WSS of their points on this polynomial to a VSS, we can use this linear relation together with the Linear Computation Lemma to compute a <span class="load-definable">verified secret</span> of the missing \(\beta\)'s and make them public. Now it holds, that either \(\beta_i^u\) was shared, using VSS, or it was made public.</p>
									</li>
									<li>The player \(P_i\) computes \(\beta_i^u*\beta_i^v=\beta_i^{u*v}\), and distributes it with a new polynomial \(h_i^{u*v}(x)\), using the VSS protocol. Then the player proves that \(h^u_i(0)*h_i^v(0)=h_i^{u*v}(0)\), as described above in Lemma 10. If the player fails to do the above, his or her pieces are reconstructed and exposed.</li>
									<li>In order to randomize the polynomial \(f_1^{u*v}(x)\), each \(P_i\) shares \(t\) random polynomials \(g_{i,j}(x)\), of degree \(t\), and proves that he or she has done just this. Using the method described in <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span>, they generate a random polynomial of degree \(2t\) with a zero free coefficient. By adding this polynomial to \(f_1^{u*v}(x)\) we obtain a new random polynomial \(f_2^{u*v}(x)\) with the same free coefficient.</li>
									<li>To preform the reduction of the degree of the polynomial, \(f_2^{u*v}(x)\) to degree \(t\), we carry out the linear computation described in <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span>. If a player doesn't cooperate, his or her piece is revealed using the VSS for this piece. The result of this computation will be that each player holds a verified share of a piece of \(u*v\), shared by the polynomial \(f^{u*v}(x)\) of degree \(t\), so that \(f^{u*v}(0)=f_1^{u*v}(0)\). Each player manages to compute that player's own, new piece, after all information held by the other players has been passed on to him or her.</li>
									<li>
										<p>As a result of the above computation, the following facts hold:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Each player holds a share \(\beta_i^{u*v}\) of the secret \(u*v\).</li>
											<li>This piece is already shared using VSS.</li>
											<li>Due to the VSS of \(\beta_i^{u*v}\), each player \(P_j\) holds a share \(\beta_{ij}^{u*v}\) of \(\beta_i^{u*v}\).</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											To achieve condition 3 of a <span class="load-definable">verified secret</span> for \(u*v,\,\beta_i^{u*v}\) must be shared by WSS. To transform the VSS of this piece to WSS the following is done:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The player \(P_i\) creates and distributes check vectors for all \(\beta_{ij}^{u*v}\).</li>
											<li>All players execute the <a href="#sec3.1.2">Modified Verification of Check Vectors</a>.</li>
											<li>If \(P_i\) fails to cooperate, that player's piece is exposed using the VSS for it.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
