							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p class="rp_analysis">
								<b>How to Play Any Mental Game</b> is a 1987 work by Goldreich, Micali, and Widgerson that offers a completeness theorem for any protocol with honest majority. Based on their 1986 work <i>How to Solve Any Protocol Problem</i><a href="pdf/81.1.pdf"><sup>(PDF)</sup></a>, it brings together essentially every major piece of cryptography into one central paper, providing a key piece in the development of multiparty computation protocols. By presenting the building blocks necessary to build any general problem into a private and robust protocol, this paper provides the benchmark by which every new protocol is measured.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_analysis">
								Goldreich et al.'s methods here are often compared with the garbled circuits presented by Yao <a href="24.html">a year earlier</a>.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_analysis">
								This paper is a demonstration of how <span class="load-definable">oblivious transfer</span> is <span class="load-definable" data-define="completeness">complete</span> with respect to multiparty computation; that is, any oblivious transfer primitive can construct a multiparty computation evaluator for any function.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section id="a_goals" data-section-name="Goals and Results">
							<h2>Goals and Results</h2>
							<p class="rp_analysis">
								<i>How to Play Any Mental Game</i> makes a big promise with both its title and its premise, and it delivers on that promise fully. Given any <span class="load-definable">Turing machine</span> \(M\) for \(n\) players, it provides a meta-protocol by which we can produce a new distributed protocol \(D\), making the following guarantees:
							</p>
							<ul class="rp_analysis">
								<li>No number of <span class="load-definable" data-define="passive adversary">passive adversaries</span> will be able to learn anything from \(D\) that they could not have learned by using a <span class="load-definable">trusted party</span> instead.</li>
								<li>As long as the majority of players are not <span class="load-definable" data-define="malicious adversary">malicious</span>, the output of \(D\) will be identical to \(M\) (or, in the case of \(M\) being probabilistic, will have an identical probability distribution).</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="rp_analysis">
								Since this is true for <i>any</i> Turing machine, this means that this paper provides a completeness theorem. <b>Any singular function can be computed using cryptographic multiparty computation, assuming honest majority.</b> This paper does not address problems in which different people compute different functions.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_analysis">
								In particular, Goldreich et al. incorporate oblivious transfer, hardcore bits, zero knowledge proofs, 5-permutations, game theory concepts, and the translation from Turing machines to circuits (and circuits to straight line programs) into their meta-protocol.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section id="a_assumptions" data-section-name="Assumptions">
							<h2>Assumptions</h2>
							<p class="rp_analysis">
								All of the above operates under the assumption that <span class="load-definable" data-define="trapdoor function">trapdoor functions</span> exist, a relatively low burden of assumption. Only a year later, <a href="34.html">Chaum, Cr&eacute;peau, and Damg&aring;rd</a> demonstrated a similar completeness theorem for <span class="load-definable">information theoretic security</span> using an even lower burden of assumption.

							<h3>Abstract</h3>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given as input the description of a game with incomplete information and any number of players, produces a protocol for playing the game that leaks no partial information, provided the majority of the players is honest.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Our algorithm automatically solves all the multi-party protocol problems addressed in complexity-based cryptography during the last 10 years. It actually is a completeness theorem for the class of distributed protocols with honest majority. Such completeness theorem is optimal in the sense that, if the majority of the players is not honest, some protocol problems have no efficient solution.

							<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Before discussing how to "make <span class="load-definable" data-define="purely playable game">playable</span>" a general game with incomplete information (which we do in <a href="#sec6">section 6</a>) let us address the problem of making playable a special class of games, the <span class="load-definable" data-define="Turing machine game">Turing machine games</span> (<i>Tm-games</i> for short).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Informally, \(n\) parties, respectively and individually owning secret inputs \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) would like to <i>correctly</i> run a given <span class="load-definable">Turing machine</span> \(M\) on these \(x_i\)‘s while keeping the maximum possible privacy about them. That is, they want to compute \(y=M(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) without revealing more about the \(x_i\)’s than it is already contained in the value \(y\) itself. For instance, if \(M\) computes the sum of the \(x_i\)’s, every single player should not be able to learn more than the sum of the inputs of the other parties. Here \(M\) may very well be a probabilistic Turing machine. In this case, all player want to agree on a single string \(y\), selected with the right probability distribution, as \(M\)’s output.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The correctness and privacy constraint of a Tm-game can be easily met with the help of an extra, <span class="load-definable">trusted party</span> \(P\). Each player \(i\) simply gives his secret input \(x_i\) to \(P\). \(P\) will privately run the prescribed Turing machine, \(M\), on these inputs and publicly announce \(M\)’s output. Making a Tm-game playable essentially means that the correctness and privacy constraints can be satisfied by the \(n\) players themselves, without invoking any extra party. Proving that Tm-games are playable retains most of the flavor and difficulties of our general theorem.

									If \(A(\cdot)\) is a probabilistic algorithm, then for any input \(x\) the notation \(A(x)\) refers to the RV which assigns to the string \(\sigma\) the probability that \(A\), on input \(x\) outputs \(\sigma\). If \(S\) is a RV that assigns positive probability only to a single element \(e\), we denote the value \(e\) by \(S\).

All machines share a common read-only input tape and a common write-only output tape. The \(n\) machines communicate by means of \(n\cdot(n-1)\) special tapes. Machine \(i\) publicly sends messages (strings) to machine \(j\) by means of a special tape \(i \rightarrow j\) on which only \(i\) can write and that all other machines can read. There is a common clock whose pulses define time intervals \(1,2,\dots\). Messages are sent at the beginning of a time interval and are received within the same time interval. We stress, though, that our result is largely independent from the specific communication mechanism, and also holds for "less equipped" communication networks.<sup id="fref1" class="footnote" data-footnote="1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

								<h3>2.3. Adversaries</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We consider two interesting types of adversaries (faulty machines) in a <span class="load-definable">game network</span>: passive ones (a new notion) and malicious ones (a more standard notion).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									A <span class="load-definable">passive adversary</span> is a machine that may compute more than required by its prescribed program, but the messages it sends and what it outputs are in accordance to its original program. (Passive adversaries may be thought of as machines who only try to violate the privacy constraint. They keep on running their prescribed programs correctly, but also run, “on the side”, their favorite polynomial time program to try to compute more than their due share of knowledge. In an election protocol, a passive adversary may be someone who respects the majority’s opinion&mdash;and thus does not want to corrupt the tally&mdash;and yet wants to discover who voted for whom.)
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									A <span class="load-definable">malicious adversary</span> is, instead, a machine that deviates from its prescribed program in any possible action. That is, we allow the program of such a machine to be replaced by any fixed probabilistic polynomial-time program. (Malicious adversaries not only have a better change of disrupting the privacy constraint, but could also make the outcome of a <span class="load-definable" data-define="Turing machine game">Tm-game</span> vastly different than in an ideal run with a <span class="load-definable">trusted party</span>.)

								<p class="rp_original">
									We allow machines in a game network to become adversarial in a <span class="load-definable" data-define="adaptive adversary">dynamic</span> fashion, during the execution of a protocol. We also allow adversarial machines (of either type) to undetectedly cooperate. Adversarial machines are not allowed, however, to monitor the private tapes or the internal state of good machines.

								<p class="rp_original">
									We believe the malicious-adversary scenario to be the most adversarial among all the natural scenarios in which cryptography may help.

								<h3>2.4. Indistinguishability of Random Variables</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Throughout this paper, we will only consider families of RVs \(U=\{U_k\}\) where the parameter \(k\) ranges in the natural numbers. Let \(U=\{U_k\}\) and \(V=\{V_k\}\) be two families of RVs. The following notion of computational indistinguishability expresses the fact that, when the length of \(k\) increases, \(U_k\) becomes “replaceable” by \(V_k\), in the following sense. A random sample is selected either from \(U\), or from \(V\), and it is handed to a “judge”. After studying the sample, the judge will proclaim his verdict: 0 or 1. (We may interpret 0 as the judge’s decision that that the sample came from \(U_k\); 1 as the decision that the sample came from \(V_k\).) It is then natural to say that \(U_k\) becomes “replaceable” by \(V_k\) for \(k\) large enough if, when \(k\) increases, the verdict of any computationally bounded judge becomes “meaningless”, that is essentially uncorrelated to which of the two distributions the sample came from.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									To formalize the notion of computational indistinguishability we make use of nonuniformity. Thus, our "judge", rather than polynomial time <span class="load-definable">Turing machine</span>, will be a <span class="load-definable">poly-size family of circuits</span>. That is a family \(C=\{C_k\}\) of Boolean circuits \(C_k\) with one Boolean output such that, for some constants \(e,d&gt;0\), all \(C_k\in C\) have at most \(k^e\) gates and \(k^d\) Boolean inputs. In order to feed samples from our probability distributions to such circuits, we will consider only <span class="load-definable" data-define="poly-bounded family of random variables">poly-bounded families of RVs</span>. That is families \(U=\{U_k\}\) such that, for some constant \(e&gt;0\), all RV \(U_k\in U\) assigns positive probability only to strings whose length is exactly \(k^e\). If \(U=\{U_k\}\) is a poly-bounded family of RVs and \(C=\{C_k\}\) a poly-bounded sequence of circuits, we denote by \(P(U,C,k)\) the probability that \(C_k\) outputs 1 on input a random string from \(U_k\). (Here we assume that the length of the strings that are assigned positive probability by \(U_k\) equals the number of Boolean inputs of \(C_k\).)

								Notice that passive adversaries appear in the above definition in an implicit way. Algorithm \(A\) can be thought as all the members of \(T\) being passive adversaries computing after an execution of \(S\). In fact, passive adversaries are obliged to send messages according to \(S\) and their private history, in an execution of \(S\), as an explicit input to \(A\). Let us stress that the private history of a machine \(i\) contains the name \(i\), the private input \(x_i\), and \(M\)'s output as well. Thus the privacy constraint essentially says that whatever the passive adversaries may compute after computing \(S\), they could also easily deduce from the desired \(M\)'s output \(y\) and their own private inputs (which they are entitled to have!). In fact, if they are given \(y\) by running \(S\), the passive adversaries will see, in addition to \(y\), only the public history and their own private history. However, whatever they could efficiently compute with this additional input, they could also have computed without it. In other words, \(S\) keeps whatever privacy of the inputs of the good parties is not "betrayed" by the value of \(y\) itself. For instance, if \(M\) computes the sum of the \(x_i\)'s, then the privacy constraint will allow the adversarial players to compute (at the end of \(S\)) essentially only the sum of the inputs of the good parties. As for another example, if \(M\) is the identity function, then the privacy constraint holds vacuously. Same if the set \(T\) is the set of all players.

								<h3>4.1. A New and General Oblivious Transfer Protocol</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									In <span class="reference" data-citation="HR"></span>, Rabin proposes the beautiful notion of an <span class="load-definable">oblivious transfer</span>. This is a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that allows A(lice), who knows the prime factorization of an integer \(n\), to send it to B(ob), who knows just \(n\), so that B will receive \(n\)'s factorization with probability &frac12; and A does not know whether or not B received it. Clearly, Rabin's notion of an OT supposes that factoring is computationally hard. Under this assumption, he proposed a protocol that, if A and B are allowed to be at most <span class="load-definable" data-define="passive adversary">passive adversaries</span>, correctly implements an OT. This protocol, however, may not work (i.e. no longer possesses a proof of correctness) if A and B are allowed to be <span class="load-definable" data-define="malicious adversary">malicious</span>. Using the interactive proof-systems of <span class="reference" data-citation="GM"></span>, Fischer, Micali, Rackoff, and Wittenberg found<sup class="reference" data-citation="FMR"></sup> a protocol that correctly implements OT under the simple (and in this context minimal) assumption that factoring is hard. Rabin's OT has proved to be a very fruitful notion, as exemplified by various applications proposed by Blum.<sup class="reference" data-citation="Bl"></sup>
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									A more general and useful notion of OT has been proposed by Even, Goldreich, and Lempel<sup class="reference" data-citation="EGL"></sup>, the <span class="load-definable" data-define="one-out-of-two oblivious transfer">one-out-of-two OT</span>. In their framework, A has two messages, \(m_0\) and \(m_1\). By using a cryptosystem \(E\) she computes \(\sigma_0=E(m_0)\) and \(\sigma_1=E(m_1)\) and sends \(\sigma_0, \sigma_1\) to B. B chooses one of these encryptions, \(\sigma_i\). A one-out-of-two OT allows B to read the corresponding message \(m_i\), while A will not know which message B has read (whenever \(m_0\neq m_1\)). This notion achieves the right level of generality and is crucial to what follows. Even, Goldreich, and Lempel also proposed the first implementation of a one-out-of-two OT using public-key cryptosystems. Their protocol has the merit of having freed the implementation of an oblivious transfer from the algebraic setting to which it appeared to be confined. Their protocol, though, requires a quite strong set of assumptions even when the adversaries are only passive.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Below, we contribute a new protocol that correctly implements a one-out-of-two OT in presence of passive adversaries. The existence of <span class="load-definable" data-define="trapdoor permutation">trapdoor permutations</span> suffices to prove the correctness of our protocol.
								</p>
								<section id="sec4.1.1" data-section-name="Trapdoor and One-Way Functions">
									<h4>4.1.1. Trapdoor and One-Way Functions</h4>
									<p class="rp_original">
										A satisfactory definition of a <span class="load-definable" data-define="trapdoor permutation">trapdoor permutation</span> is given in <span class="reference" data-citation="GMRi"></span>. Here, let us informally say that a family of trapdoor permutations \(f\) possesses the following properties:
									</p>
									<ul class="rp_original">
										<li>It is easy, given an integer \(k\), to randomly select permutations \(f\) in the family which have \(k\) as their security parameter, together with some extra "trapdoor" information allowing easy inversion of the permutations chosen.</li>
										<li>It is easy to randomly select a point in \(f\)'s domain.</li>
										<li>It is hard to invert \(f\) without knowing \(f\)'s trapdoor on a random element in \(f\)'s domain.</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="rp_original">
										We can interpret the above by saying that a party A can randomly select a pair of permutations, \((f,f^{-1})\), inverses of each other. This will enable A to easily evaluate and invert \(f\); if now A publicizes \(f\) and keeps secret \(f^{-1}\), then inverting \(f\) will be hard for any other party. We may write \(f_k\) to emphasize that \(k\) is the security parameter of our permutation.

										Our <span class="load-definable" data-define="one-out-of-two oblivious transfer">one-out-of-two OT</span> protocol makes use of the <span class="load-definable" data-define="trapdoor function">trapdoor functions</span> \(f\) hiding a random bit \(B_f\). Here \(B_f\) is a polynomial-time computable Boolean function; the word "bit" is appropriate as \(B_f\) evaluates to 1 for half of the values in \(f\)'s domain.
									</p>
									<p class="rp_original">
										We say that \(\{B_f\}\) is a <span class="load-definable" data-define="hardcore bit">random bit</span> in a family \(\{f\}\) of trapdoor permutations if \(\forall\) predicting algorithm \(Alg\) that, on inputs \(f=f_k\) and \(f(x)\), outputs, in \(T(k)\) steps, a guess for \(B_f((x))\) that is correct with probability \(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon, \exists Alg'\) that, on inputs \(f\) and \(f(x)\), outputs \(x\) in \(poly(T(k),\epsilon^{-1})\) expected time.
									</p>
									<p class="rp_annotation">
										In other words, if you can determine \(B_f(x)\) from \(f(x)\) in time \(S\) with probability \(\epsilon\), you can determine \(x\) within time \(\frac{S}{\epsilon}^c\) for some \(c\). Note that it was originally written as just probability \(\epsilon\), but that is easily disproved by counterexample: a constant algorithm which returns \(1\) will be correct with probability \(\frac{1}{2}\), but does not suggest the existence of an algorithm which calculates \(x\) in constant time (\(poly(T(k),2)\)), but rather implies nothing at all: since \(\epsilon=0\), it implies \(x\) can be calculated in infinite time (\(poly(T(k),\infty)\)).
									</p>
									<p class="rp_original">
										Thus, \(f\) being trapdoor, no probabilistic, polynomial-time algorithm given \(f_k(x)\), can correctly predict \(B_{f_k}(x)\) with probability \(\geq\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{poly(k)}\). We might as well flip a coin. Thus, for a one-way permutation \(f\), given \(f(x)\) the value of \(B_f(x)\) cannot be guessed in polynomial time essentially better than at random.

									<p class="rp_annotation">
										Again note that probability of \(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{poly(k)}\) is <span class="load-definable" data-define="negligible">non-negligible</span>, so it should be \(\geq\), not &gt; as it was originally. Since by definition of a trapdoor permutation we cannot determine determine \(x\) given \(f(x)\) in polynomial time, \(\epsilon^{-1}\) must be greater than polynomial in \(k\), so \(\epsilon &lt; \frac{1}{poly(k)}\), and therefore is negligible.

As \(f\) is a permutation, randomly selecting \(x\) in \(f\)'s domain and computing \(f(x)\) yields a randomly selected element in \(f\)'s domain. Thus \((u,v)\) is a pair of randomly selected elements in \(f\)'s domain both if \(\alpha=0\) or \(\alpha=1\). As \((u,v)\) is the only message \(B\) sends to \(A\), not even with infinite computing power will \(A\) find out whether \(B\) has read \(b_0\) or \(b_1\).

										Notice that the protocol makes use of the fact that the adversaries are at most passive in a crucial way.

								<h3>4.2. Strengthening Yao's Combined Oblivious Transfer</h3>
								<section data-section-name="The Tm-game Solver for passive adversaries">
									<p class="rp_original">
										In <span class="reference" data-citation="Y2"></span>, Yao presented a protocol that we call <span class="load-definable">combined oblivious transfer</span> (COT). The protocol involves two parties A and B, respectively owning private inputs \(a\) and \(b\) and any chosen function \(g\). It possesses the following property: upon termination, A computes \(g(a,b)\), while B has no idea of what A has computed. If we think of \(a\) and \(b\) as secrets, B appears to be obliviously transferring a prescribed combination of his and A's secret to A. Yao implemented COT based on the assumption that factoring is hard, (which yields, as shown by <span class="reference" data-citation="Bl"></span>) a particular <span class="load-definable">trapdoor permutation</span>. We strengthen his result by showing that COT can be correctly implemented based on any trapdoor permutation. We do this by using the <span class="load-definable" data-define="one-out-of-two oblivious transfer">one-out-of-two OT</span> of <a href="#sec4.1">section 4.1</a> within Yao's scheme. Let us consider first the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are bits and \(g\) is the Boolean \(AND\). Consider figure 1.
									</p>
									<img src="../../img/81.fig1.jpg" alt="A COT AND-gate" class="rp_original" />
									<p class="rp_original">
										Here \(E_1,\dots,E_6\) are independently selected encryption algorithms, respectively having decryption keys \(D_1,\dots,D_6\). \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) label the first input-wire, \(E_3\) and \(E_4\) the second input-wire, and \(E_5\) and \(E_6\) the output-wire. Each row in the gate is formed by the encryption of two strings. \(c\) and \(d\) are two randomly selected strings whose bit-by-bit exclusive-or equals \(D_5\). \(p\) and \(q\) are two randomly selected strings whose XOR equals \(D_6\); so are \(s\) and \(t\); so are \(u\) and \(v\). The 4 rows have been put in the gate in random order. \(E_1E_2\) and \(E_5E_6\) are publicly labelled by complementary bits. \(E_3\) and \(E_4\) are each secretly labelled by a bit; more precisely, \(E_3\) is SECRETLY labelled 0 with probability &frac12; and \(E_4\) is labelled with the complement of \(E_3\)'s bit. (This secrecy is pictorially indicated by drawing \(E_3\) and \(E_4\)'s bits by a dotted line.) Define the value of a wire to be 0 (1) if one ONLY possesses the decoding algorithm of encryption algorithm labelled 0 (1). Then figure 1 is an and-gate. For instance, assume that both the input-wires have value 0. That is, one possesses only \(D_1\) and \(D_4\). Then one is able to decrypt both entries only in the third row. By taking the xor of \(u\) and \(v\), one easily obtains \(D_6\), but has no idea what \(D_5\) may be. Thus the output-wire has value \(0=AND(0,0)\).
									</p>
									<p class="rp_annotation">
										Corrections: replaced \(m\) and \(n\) with \(c\) and \(d\) to match the diagram. Also replaced "or-gate" with "and-gate".
									</p>
									<p class="rp_original">
										To COTransfer \(AND(a,b)\), B generates a COT AND-gate like in figure 1, keeping for himself all decoding algorithms and all the strings in the rows. Then he gives A the decoding algorithm of the second input-wire that corresponds to the value of \(b\), his own input. Notice that as the association between \(E_3,E_4\) and 0,1 is secret (and \(E_1,E_2,E_3,E_4\) enter symmetrically in the gate rows), this will not betray \(b\) at all. Now A will get either \(D_1\) or \(D_2\) according to the value of \(a\) by means of <a href="#sec4.1.3">our</a> <span class="load-definable" data-define="one-out-of-two oblivious transfer">one-out-of-two OT</span>. Thus, B will not know which algorithm she got. At this point A can easily compute the value of the output wire. Thus, she will be the only one to know \(AND(a,b)\).
									</p>
									<p class="rp_original">
										It is trivial to build a COT NOT gate. Notice that B may also keep secret the corresponding between 0,1 and \(E_5,E_6\).
									</p>
									<p class="rp_annotation">
										Specifically, in a NOT gate, Alice has \(D_0\) (\(D_1\)) transferred to her, and they decode \(D_3\) (\(D_2\)), where \(D_0,D_2\) correspond to 0, and \(D_1,D_3\) correspond to 1. This is just as simply done within a gate (that is, by switching the order of the input(s) or outputs of a gate).
									</p>
									<img src="../../img/81.fig2.jpg" alt="Two COT gates" class="rp_original" />
									<p class="rp_original">
										This allows the output wire to become an input wire of another gate. If the encryption algorithms of this second gate are publically labelled 0/1 (see fig. 2), we see that A may evaluate any 2-gates function on her and B's inputs, without knowing intermediate results. Better said, B can "COTransfer" the value of any 2-gates function. By cascading this way COT AND-gates and COT NOT-gates (which are trivial to design), we can see that B can COTransfer the value of any function, provided that there is an upper bound to the length of A's and B's inputs, (else, the length of the inputs will be betrayed).

									<p class="rp_annotation">
										Note that the NAND gate is complete on <span class="load-definable" data-define="GF(2)">GF(2)</span>, so we can indeed create any function.

								<h3>4.3. The Tm-game Solver for passive adversaries</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Recall that a <span class="load-definable" data-define="Turing machine game">Tm-game</span> solver wants to compute \(M(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) while respecting the privacy constraint. We want to use <span class="load-definable" data-define="combined oblivious transfer">COT</span> as a subroutine to construct a Tm-solver. This does not appear to be straightforward. For instance, if two parties \(i\) and \(j\) use COT so that \(i\) will compute \(g(x_i,x_j)\) for some function \(g\), this would already be a violation of the privacy constraint. Recall also that the Tm-game solver has to be polynomial not only in \(M\)'s running time, but also in \(n\), the number of players.

								<p class="rp_original">
									We find a way out by making special use of a lemma of Barrington's<sup class="reference" data-citation="Br"></sup> that simulates computation by composing permutations in \(S_5\), the symmetric group on 5 elements. The general picture is the following. First, transform the <span class="load-definable">Turing machine</span> \(M\) of a Tm-game to an equivalent circuit \(C\) in a standard way. The Boolean inputs of \(C\) will be \(b_1^1,\dots,b_l^1,\dots,b_1^n,\dots,b_l^n\), the bits of the \(n\), \(l\)-bit long inputs of our parties. This circuit \(C\) is then transformed to <span class="load-definable">straight-line program</span> as in <span class="reference" data-citation="Br"></span>. This straight-line program is essentially as long as \(C\) is big. In it,

									<li>0,1 are encoded by two (specially selected) 5-permutations</li>
									<li>the variables range in \(S_5\) and</li>
									<li>each instruction consists of multiplying (composing) two 5-permutations \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\), where \(\sigma\) (\(\tau\)) is either a constant, a variable, or the inverse (in \(S_5\)) of a variable.</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									Exactly when and how to perform each of these instructions in order to compute a program is explained by Barrington, and is outside the scope of this paper.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									At the start, each party takes each of his private bits and encodes it by a 5-permutation \(\sigma\) as in <span class="reference" data-citation="Br"></span>. Then he divides \(\sigma\). That is, he selects at random \(n-1\) 5-permutations \(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_{n-1}\) and gives the pair \((i,\sigma_i)\) to party \(i\) (possibly himself). He then sets \(\sigma_n=(\sigma_1\cdots\sigma_{n-1})^{-1}\cdot\sigma\) and gives \((n,\sigma_n)\) to party \(n\). Now, inductively, assume that each variable is divided among the parties. That is, for each variable \(\sigma\), each player \(i\) possesses an index permutation pair \((x,\sigma_x)\) so that \(\prod\limits_{x=1}^n\sigma_x=\sigma\) and, given only \(n-1\) pieces, \(\sigma\) cannot be guessed better than at random. We now want to show that each instruction can be performed (i.e. that each party can compute his individual piece of the result) respecting the privacy constraint. There are essentially 3 cases.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									<i>Case 1</i>: The instruction is of the form \(\sigma\cdot c\), where \(\sigma\) is a variable and \(c\) a constant. By induction, each party has a piece of the form \((x,\sigma_x)\). Then the party owning the piece \((n,\sigma_n)\) sets his new piece to be \((n,\sigma_n\cdot c)\) and all other parties leave their pieces untouched. It is immediately checked that the ordered product of the new pieces is \(\sigma\cdot c\) and that privacy has been preserved against \(n-1\) <span class="load-definable" data-define="passive adversary">passive adversaries</span>.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									<i>Case 2</i>: The instruction is of the form \(\sigma^{-1}\cdot c\) where, again, \(\sigma\) is a variable and \(c\) a constant. It will be enough to show how to compute pieces for \(\sigma^{-1}\) respecting the privacy constraint. To do this, if a party has a piece \((x,\sigma_x)\), he sets his new piece to be \((n-x+1, \sigma_x^{-1})\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									<i>Case 3</i>: the instruction is of the form \(\sigma\cdot\tau\), where both \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) are variables. Then \(\sigma\cdot\tau=\sigma_1\cdots\sigma_n\cdot\tau_1\cdots\tau_n\), and assume for simplicity that party \(i\) possesses piece \(\sigma_i\) and \(\tau_i\). Unfortunately, party 1 cannot compute his piece of \(\sigma\cdot\tau\) by multiplying his own two pieces. In fact, they are \(n\) positions apart in the product and \(S_5\) is not <span class="load-definable" data-define="commutativity">commutative</span> (a fact crucial in Barrington's argument). The idea will then consist of making "partial progress". That is, moving party 1's pieces closer together by "swapping" \(\sigma_n\) and \(\tau_1\). This can be correctly accomplished by giving party 1 a piece \(\tau_1'\) and party \(n\) a piece \(\sigma_n'\) so that \(\tau_1'\cdot\sigma_n'=\sigma_n\cdot\tau_1\). This way the product of the new (and newly ordered pieces) would remain \(\sigma\cdot\tau\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									So more specifically, we want party \(i\) for \(i\leq\frac{n}{2}\) to have \(\sigma_{2i-1},\sigma_{2i}\), and party \(i\) for \(i\gt\frac{n+1}{2}\) to have \(\tau_{2i-n},\tau_{2i-n+1}\). If we have an odd number of parties, party \(\frac{n+1}2\) will have pieces \(\sigma_n,\tau_1\). Since we can only swap pieces that are adjacent to each other in the overall product, we will need to perform \(O(n^2)\) swaps. [Paragaph break not originally present.]
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									<i>[Case 3 cont.:]</i> One way of doing this would be of having party 1 and party \(n\) tell each other \(\sigma_n\) and \(\tau_1\). However, this would violate the privacy constraint with respect to a set of \(n-1\) passive adversaries. Instead, we use COT in the following way. Party \(n\) randomly selects a 5-permutation \(\rho\). Consider now the function \(g\) such that, for 5-permutations \(x\),\(y\), and \(z\), \(g(x,(y,z))=w\) where \(w\cdot z=y\cdot x\). Let now party 1 (with the role of A and input \(a=\tau_1\)) and party \(n\) (with the role of B and input \(b=(\sigma_n,\rho)\)) play COT with the function \(g\). Set \(\tau_1'=g(a,b)\) and \(\sigma_n'=\rho\). Then we have made the desired partial progress.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									We should note, however, that such a function would not be particularly trivial. [Paragaph break not originally present.]
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									<i>[Case 3 cont.:]</i> In fact, not only the product of the new pieces is unaltered, but we have also respected the privacy constraint. Informally, party \(n\)'s new piece is a random 5-permutation selected by party \(n\) personally and thus can provide any information neither about party 1's old piece nor the new one; moreover the transference of \(g(a,b)\) is oblivious and thus cannot give party \(n\) any knowledge either. On the other side, party 1 is dealt a new piece \(g(\tau_1,(\sigma_n,\rho))\) and knows \(\tau_1\). However, as for all \(x\) and \(y\), \(g(x,(y,\cdot))\) is <span class="load-definable">injective</span> on \(S_5\), and \(\rho\) has been randomly and secretly selected by party \(n\), so party 1 does not get any knowledge that he or she did not possess before!
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									We will offer a slightly more formal outline through a simulation argument (under the assumption that the intermediate steps of the transfer are oblivious). We hope to show that party 1 can produce a transcript \(t\) for an interaction with party \(n\) that is computationally indistinguishable from an actual run of COT.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									After fixing \(\sigma\), we start by noting that \(g\) is not only injective, but also surjective (easily provable since any 5-permutation is reachable from any other 5-permutation in one composition), and therefore bijective. Bijections have the property that the probability distribution of their output is also in a bijection with the probability distribution of their input; therefore, we know that the probability distribution party 1 sees on \(w\) is identical to the distribution on \(\rho\), for fixed \(\sigma\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									We know the probability distribution on \(\rho\) to be constant, since \(\rho\) was chosen randomly, so we know that \(w\)'s distribution is statistically indistinguishable from being picked uniformly at random as well. This situation is independent of \(\sigma\), since \(\sigma\) is always fixed before \(\rho\) is chosen.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									With that in mind, we can show that party 1 can easily simulate a run of the protocol&mdash;not knowing \(\sigma\) or \(\rho\)&mdash;that is computationally indistinguishable from a real run. Party 1 performs the correct garbled circuit, but chooses a random decryption at each input gate for party \(n\)'s simulated 'input': since \(n\) was going to assign a decryption to his bits at random anyway, and party 1 cannot possibly learn the association, this is indistinguishable. Every internal gate's table can simply be assigned at random, since party 1 never learns anything about its inputs or outputs in either case. Party 1 also assigns each output gate's table randomly so that the full gate's output is any valid \(5\)-permutation; since, as we showed above, \(w\)'s probability distribution is indistinguishable from being selected uniformly at random, we get an identical distribution through party 1 selecting at random.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									Since party 1's simulated transcript is indistinguishable from a real transcript at every input gate, at every internal gate, and at the output value, party 1 cannot possibly learn any information from this protocol&mdash;assuming, of course, that party 1 is only a passive adversary, since the one-out-of-two oblivious transfer is still vulnerable to malicious adversaries. [Paragaph break not originally present.]
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									<i>[Case 3 cont.:]</i> Notice also that during this "swap" we did not create any other pieces. Thus, after \(n\) "swaps" the only two pieces of party 1 will be in the first two positions in the product and he can thus multiply them together. This product will be party 1's piece for the variable \(\sigma\cdot\tau\). It should be verified that the entire walk of party 1 \(\tau\)-piece towards the left preserves correctness and does not violate the privacy constraint. Essentially because a new, random piece is created at each step. This way, after \(O(n^2)\) "swaps", and in polynomial time, all parties receive their piece of \(\sigma\cdot\tau\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									At the end of the straight-line program, for each output variable \(\gamma\), each party publicizes his own piece \((x,\gamma_x)\), the ordered product of these pieces is computed, and the output bit recovered so as to satisfy both the correctness and the privacy constraint. (A more formal argument will be given in the final paper.)
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									Before moving on, we should bring up an interesting special case that simplifies the problem significantly. When only dealing with two parties, it becomes much easier to drop the entire 5-permutation concept as being too computationally expensive, and instead dealing with exclusive or's.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									For each of their input bits \(b_i\), both parties (\(P_1\) and \(P_2\)) transmit to the other a random bit \(r_i\), and keep for their own "share" \(r_i\oplus b_i\). As always in Boolean circuits, it suffices to demonstrate how to perform NOT, XOR, and AND.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									NOT gates are trivial: one party flips their own share, and the other party does nothing.
								</p>

									XOR gates, too, are simple. Since XOR is commutative, the two parties can XOR any two values by both XORing their own shares of those values. If the two parties are XORing \(b_1\) and \(b_2\), where \(P_1\) has shares \(b^1_1, b^1_2\) and \(P_2\) has shares \(b^2_1,b^2_2\), they are attempting to evaluate \(b_1\oplus b_2=(b_1^1\oplus b_1^2)\oplus(b_2^1\oplus b_2^2)=(b_1^1\oplus b_2^1) \oplus (b_1^2\oplus b_2^2)\). Since the two parties wish, at the end, to have one share each that XORs to the correct value, the XORs of their own shares clearly work perfectly.

									AND gates are a tad more complex, since XOR does not distribute. To compute the AND of two bits \(b_1,b_2\) where, as above, party \(P_i\) possesses shares \(b^i_x\) for \(x\in\{1,2\}\), one of the parties (for concreteness, \(P_1\)) computes a truth table for the output bit \(b_3\), using the 4 possible shares of the other party and their own known shares:

							<h2>5. Malicious Adversaries</h2>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The complexity of our <span class="load-definable" data-define="Turing machine game">Tm-game</span> solver greatly increases when up to half of the players is allowed to be <span class="load-definable" data-define="malicious adversary">malicious</span> and can more powerfully collaborate to try to disrupt the correctness and the privacy constraints. We used essentially all the cryptographic tools developed in the last ten years in the (correct) hope that they would make possible protocol design. Also, the proof of its correctness is rather delicate and unsuitable for an abstract. We will give it in the final paper. Here we only indicate what making <span class="load-definable" data-define="purely playable game">playable</span> a Tm-game with malicious adversaries may <i>mean</i> and which general ideas are involved in our solution.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								As in this case some of the parties may not follow their prescribed programs at all, it is necessary to clarify what a private input is. After all, what stops someone from pretending that his private input is different from what it actually is? To avoid this, we assume that the parties have established their private inputs by <span class="load-definable" data-define="commitment">announcing correct encodings</span> of them. Their inputs are <i>by definition</i> the unique decryption of their respective encodings. Moreover, it should be clear that seeking a solution to a Tm-game problem makes sense only if the parties are "willing to play". If, say, one of them "commits suicide", carrying with himself what his private input was, there is very little one can do besides investing exponential time and break his encryption. However we can, loosely speaking, prove that:
							</p>
							<span class="rp_theorem_header" id="theorem2">Theorem 2</span>
							<p class="rp_original rp_theorem">
								Given \(n\) players willing to play, less than half of which are <span class="load-definable" data-define="malicious adversary">malicious</span>, all <span class="load-definable" data-define="Turing machine game">Tm-games</span> are <span class="load-definable" data-define="purely playable game">playable</span>.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The above term "willing to play" indicates a technical condition rather than a psychological one. Namely, having successfully completed the engagement protocol. After completing this protocol, all players can be forced to play any desired game. The engagement protocol consists of two phases.
							</p>
							<ol class="rp_original">
								<li value="1">
									For each player \(i\), a protocol is performed at the end of which no minority of the players can even predict a bit of \(i\)'s private input with chances essentially better than &frac12;. However, it is <i>guaranteed</i> that any subset of cardinality \(&gt;n/2\) can, without the cooperation or even against the actions of other players, easily compute \(i\)'s private input.
								</li>
								<li value="2">
									The community deals to each player a sequence of encrypted "random" bits so that, a) the recipient knows their decryption, b) they appear unpredictable to any minority of the players, but c) they are easily computable by any majority of the players.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We stress that, while no one can be forced to complete the engagement protocol (so to become "willing to play"), no one can decide not to complete it because he received a better idea of what the result of the subsequent game may be. Completing the engagement protocol will not give any player (or any small enough group of players) any knowledge about the others' private inputs.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								In other words, the engagement protocol makes it so that a party can only choose to be malicious once they have already locked themselves into the protocol; since the protocol will soon be shown to be resistant to malicious adversaries, and the adversary can no longer interrupt the protocol by leaving, maliciousness is essentially rendered moot.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Phase 1 of the engagement protocol consists of a verifiable secret sharing in the sense of Awerbuch, Chor, Goldwasser, and Micali<sup class="reference" data-citation="CGM"></sup>. However, we contribute a new protocol both tolerating up to \(\frac{n}{2}\) malicious adversaries and using any <span class="load-definable">trapdoor function</span> whatsoever. Phase 2 of the engagement protocol is the multi-party version of Blum's <span class="load-definable" data-define="coin flip">coin flipping</span> by telephone<sup class="reference" data-citation="Bl"></sup>. Despite the (deceptive) similarity with the verifiable secret sharing of phase 1, to implement phase 2 we must make use of a yet unpublished theorem (and algorithm) of ACGM.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We now give a bird's eye view of how to make any Tm-game \(g\) playable despite malicious adversaries. On input \((M,1^k)\), we first run the engagement protocol, then the <span class="load-definable" data-define="passive adversary">passive-adversary</span> playable version of the Tm-game. Here, we require all parties to use, as their private inputs, the strings they shared in phase 1 of the engagement protocol and, as a source of randomness, the encrypted random bits each was dealt in phase 2. The key point is that, now, no malicious adversary can deviate from his prescribed program, and thus he becomes a simple passive adversary. In fact, he is required to prove, in <span class="load-definable" data-define="zero knowledge proof">zero-knowledge</span> (in the sense of the Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff<sup class="reference" data-citation="GMRi"></sup>), that each message he sends is what he should have sent being honest, given his private input, his random choices, and the messages he received so far. (Here, an essential tool is our recent result that all <span class="load-definable">NP</span> languages possess zero-knowledge proofs<sup class="reference" data-citation="GMW"></sup>.) If a malicious party, frustrated at not being able to send messages according to a different program, decides to stop, his input and random bits will be reconstructed by the community who will compute his messages when necessary, without skewing the probability distribution of the final outcome.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								Two things to note here. First, that final point&mdash;that a majority of the community can 'rebuild' the inputs of a frustrated malicious party&mdash;is exactly why \(\frac n 2\) is precisely the (strict) maximum number of malicious parties that can be dealt with by a protocol. If more than half of the parties are colluding, then they can together perform the entire calculation without any of the honest parties, breaking the fairness and privacy constraints. If we try to create a protocol that allows more than \(\frac n 2\) parties to be malicious, then we must either allow parties to stop participating&mdash;breaking the correctness constraint&mdash;or allow a smaller subset than \(\frac n 2\) to be able to take over the protocol, which means the malicious parties could break the privacy constraints since they have such a subset. Therefore, the \(\frac n 2\) constraint is optimal.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We would like to stress our new use of <span class="load-definable" data-define="NP-complete">NP-completeness</span>. From being our most effective way to prove lower-bounds, it now becomes our most effective tool to construct correct protocols.

							<h2>6. General Games</h2>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Many actions in life, like negotiating a contract, casting a vote in a ballot, playing cards, bargaining in the market, submitting a STOC abstract, driving a car, or simply living, may be viewed as participating with others in a game with pay-offs/penalties associated with its results. This is not only true for individuals, but also for companies, governments, armies etc. that are engaged in financial, political, and physical struggles. Despite the diversity of these games, all of them can be described in the elegant mathematical framework laid out by Von Neumann and Morgenstern earlier in this century. Game theory, however, exhibits a "gap", in that it neglected to study whether, or how, or under which conditions, games can be <i>implemented</i>. That is, it never addressed the question of whether, given the description of a game, a method exists for physically or mentally playing it. We do fill this gap by showing that, in a complexity theoretic sense, all games can be played.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								In this extended abstract we will only informally clarify what and how this is. We start by briefly recalling the ingredients used by game theory to model an \(n\)-player game with incomplete information.
							</p>
							<section id="sec6.1" data-section-name="Games">
								<h3>6.1. Games</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Essentially, a game consists of a set \(S\) of possible <i>states</i>, representing all possible instantaneous descriptions of the game, a set \(M\) of possible <i>moves</i>, describing all possible ways to change the current state of the game, a set \(\{K_1,K_2,\dots,K_n\}\) of <span class="load-definable" data-define="knowledge function">knowledge functions</span>, where \(K_i(\sigma)\) represents the partial information about state \(\sigma\) possessed by player \(i\), and a function \(p\), the <span class="load-definable">pay-off function</span> that, evaluated on the final state, tells the outcome of the game. Without loss of generality, the players make moves in cyclic order and the set of possible moves in any state are the same for all states. Also <span class="load-definable">WLOG</span>, the game goes on for a fixed number of moves \(m\). With little restriction we do assume that the players make use of recursive strategies for selecting their moves. (The classical model does not rule out selecting moves according to an infinite table.)
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Let us now see how a game evolves using, <del>in parenthesis</del><ins>as annotations</ins>, poker as an example. The game starts by having "NATURE" select an initial state \(\sigma_1\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									For poker, \(\sigma_1\) is a randomly selected permutation of the 52 cards; the first \(5n\) cards of the permutation representing the players initial hands and the remaining ones the deck.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Player 1 moves first. He does not know \(\sigma_1\)&mdash;nor does anybody else&mdash;he only knows \(K_1(\sigma_1)\), his own hand.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									...the first 5 elements of permutation \(\sigma_1\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Based solely on \(K_1(\sigma_1)\), he will select a move \(\mu\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									E.g. he changes 3 cards with the first 3 cards of the deck.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									This move automatically updates the unknown current state to \(\sigma_2\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									The new state consists of the cards currently possessed by each player, the sequence of cards in the deck, and which cards were discarded by player 1. \(K_1(\sigma_2)\) consists of the new hand of player 1 and the cards he just discarded.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Now it is the turn of player 2. He also does not know the current state \(\sigma_2\), he only knows \(K_2(\sigma_2)\). Based solely on this information, he selects his move, which updates the current state, and so on. After the prescribed number of moves, the pay-off function \(p\) is evaluated at the final state to compute the result of the game.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									In poker the result consists of who has won, how much he has won, and how much everyone else has individually lost.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Note that a <span class="load-definable" data-define="Turing machine game">Tm-game</span> is indeed a game in which the initial state is empty and each player moves only once. State \(\sigma_i\) consists of the sequence of the first \(i\) moves. Each player has no knowledge about the current state and chooses his move to be the string \(x_i\), his own private input. The pay-off function \(M\) is then run on \(\sigma_n\). (Having probabilistic machines running on the final state, rather than deterministc ones, is a quite natural generalization.)
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									From this brief description it is immediately apparent that, by properly selecting the knowledge functions, one can enforce any desired  "privacy" constraints in a game.
								</p>

							<section id="sec6.2" data-section-name="Playable Games">
								<h3>6.2. Playable Games</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Game theory, besides an elegant formulation, also suggests to the players strategies satisfying some desired property (e.g. optimality). That is, game theory's primary concern is how TO SELECT MOVES WELL. However, and ironically!, it never addressed the question of how TO PLAY WELL. For a general \(n\)-player game, all we can say is that we need \(n+1\) parties to properly play it; the extra party being the "<span class="load-definable">trusted party</span>". The trusted party communicates privately with all players. At step \(t\), he knows the current state \(\sigma_t\) of the game. He kindly computes \(\alpha=K_{t\bmod{n}}(\sigma_t)\), communicates \(\alpha\) to player \(t\bmod{n}\), receives from him a move \(\mu\), secretly computes the new state \(S_{t+1}=\mu(S_t)\), and so on. At the end, the trusted party will evaluate the <span class="load-definable">pay-off function</span> on the final state and declare the outcome of the game. Clearly, playing with the trusted party achieves exactly the privacy constraints of the game description, and each player will get the correct outcome.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Now, the fact that, in general, an \(n\)-person game requires \(n+1\) people to be played, not only is grotesque, but also diminishes the otherwise wide applicability of game theory! In fact, in real-life situations, we may simply not have any trusted parties, whether persons or public computers. Recently, complaints have been raised about financial transactions in the stock market. The complaints were about the fact that some parties were enjoying knowledge that was considered "extra" before choosing their move, i.e. before buying stocks. Just another game, the stock market, but one in which you may desire trusting no one!
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We are thus led to consider the notion of a <span class="load-definable" data-define="purely playable game">(purely) playable</span> game. This is an \(n\)-person game that can be implemented by the \(n\) players without invoking any trusted parties. In general, however, given the specification of a game with complicated <span class="load-definable" data-define="knowledge function">knowledge functions</span>, it is not at all easy to decide whether it is playable in some meaningful way. Here, among the "meaningful ways", we also include non-mathematical methods. Yet the decision may still not be easy.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Poker, for instance, has simple enough knowledge functions (i.e. privacy constraints) that makes it playable in a "physical" way. In it, we use cards with cards with equal "back" and "opaque", tables whose top does not reflect light too much, we shuffle the deck "a lot", and we hand cards "facing down". All this is satisfactory as, in our physical model (the world), we only see along straight lines. However, assume we define NEWPOKER as follows. A player may select his move not only based on his own hand, but also on the knowledge of whether, combining the current hands of all players, one may form a <span class="load-definable" data-define="royal flush">royal flush</span>. NEWPOKER is certainly a game in the Von Neumann framework, but it is no longer apparent whether any physical realization of the game exists, particularly if some of the players may be cheaters.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									This is what we perceive lacking in game theory: the attention to the notion of playability. At this point, a variety of good questions naturally arises:
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original" style="text-align:center;font-style:italic">
									Is there a model (physical or mathematical) which makes all games playable?
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Or at least,
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original" style="text-align:center;font-style:italic">
									Does every game have a model in which it is playable?
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									And if not,
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original" style="text-align:center;font-style:italic">
									Should we restrict our attention to the class of playable games?

									If any <span class="load-definable">trapdoor function</span> exists, any game is <span class="load-definable" data-define="purely playable game">playable</span> if more than half of the players are honest.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Essentially our result consists of a protocol for simulating the <span class="load-definable" data-define="trusted third party">trusted party</span> of an ideal game. That is, if more than half of the players follow our protocol, whatever a player (or a set of players of size less than \(\frac{n}{2}\)) knows at any step of the game, he would have also known in an ideal execution of the game with a trusted party. In our context, the knowledge constraints are satisfied in a computational complexity sense. Namely, any player (or collection of dishonest players), in order to compute anything more than his or her due share of the current state, should perform an exponential-time computation. Unfortunately, we cannot in this extended abstract elaborate on the relationship between general games and <span class="load-definable" data-define="Turing machine game">Tm-games</span>, nor how to pass from solving the latter ones to solve the general case. We'll do this in the final paper.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_annotation">
									We have yet to find the final paper. Without it, however, we can still see some connection between games and Tm-games: since the authors specifically noted in <a href="#sec6.1">section 6.1</a> above that players must have a recursive strategy, it is likely that they connected their definition of general games to a recursive language, meaning that all general games would be decidable by some Turing machine. Since they defined Tm-games above to refer to any general Turing machine, that would mean that general games are a subset of Tm-games and therefore <a href="#theorem2">Theorem 2</a> implies <a href="#theorem 3">Theorem 3</a>.

								<h3>6.4. A Completeness Theorem for Fault-Tolerant Computation</h3>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Our main theorem has direct impact to the field of fault-tolerant computation. This is so because protocols, when properly formalized (which we will do in the final paper), are games with partial information. Thus, as long as the majority of the players is honest, all protocols may be correctly played. Actually, slightly more strongly, the correct way to play a game can be found in a uniform manner. Namely, we exhibit a specific, efficient algorithm that, on input a protocol problem, outputs an efficient, distributed protocol for solving it.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									It should be noticed that, before this, only a handful of multiparty protocol problems were given a satisfactory solution (e.g. collective <span class="load-definable" data-define="coin flip">coin flipping</span> and poker over the telephone, secret exchange, voting, and a few others). Moreover the security of some of these solutions crucially depended on the "trapdoorness" of specific functions satisfying some additional, convenient property (e.g. <span class="load-definable">multiplicativity</span>). By contrast, our completeness theorem is proved based on <i>any</i> <span class="load-definable">trapdoor function</span> (multiplicative or not, <span class="load-definable" data-define="associativity">associative</span> or not, etc.). That is, we prove that, if public-key cryptography is possible at all, then all protocol problems are (automatically!) solvable if more than half the players are honest.

						<p class="rp_original">
							The <span class="load-definable">group</span> of 5-permutations is the group of all permutations on a set of 5 (generic) elements, also known as the symmetric group \(S_5\).
						</p>
						<section id="c_notation" data-section-name="Notation">
							<h2>Notation</h2>
							<p class="rp_original">
								A permutation in \(S_5\) is usually represented as an ordering of the set \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\); since no elements are permuted in that set, \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) is the identity element. The permutation \(\{4,5,2,3,1\}\) should be interpreted as reordering any 5-element set to be the order given: so, the fourth, fifth, second, third, and first elements, in order.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Permutations of \(S_5\) are also sometimes represented by 'cycles', since it is usually a shorter way of writing less complex permutations. In cycle form, you write only which elements have shifted, and write them in parenthetical groups where the first element takes the second's place, the second element takes the third's, (etc.) and the final element takes the first's.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								As an example, the cycle \((1,3)\) always switches the first and third elements: \(\{3,2,1,4,5\}\). The cycle \((1, 5)(2,3)\) switches the first and fifth elements, and the second and third elements: \(\{5,3,2,4,1\}\). The cycle \((1,3,5)\) moves the first element to position 3, the third to position 5, and the fifth to position 1: \(\{5,2,1,4,3\}\).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The identity is written as \(()\) in cycle form, since it asks to have no elements switched
							</p>
						</section>
						<section id="c_operations" data-section-name="Operations">
							<h2>Operations</h2>
							<p class="rp_original">
								When we perform the composition operation on two permutations in \(S_5\), we pretend the left element is in the order \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) and rearrange it to fit the right element. So, for example, \(\{1,2,3,5,4\}\{5,4,3,2,1\}=\{4,5,3,2,1\}\).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Inverting a permutation is identical to writing down the locations of each value in ascending order. That is, we find value 1, and write down its location in the original element; find the value 2, and write down its location; etc. So \(\{3,1,2,5,4\}^{-1}=\{2,3,1,4,5\}\). Note that this is exactly equivalent to going from left to right and putting the values 1 through 5 in the spot specified at location 1 through 5; that is, for the previous example, put 1 in position 3 (since 3 is in position 1), put 2 in position 1 (since 1 is in position 2), etc.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								It is sometimes shorter to write operations with the cyclic form, due to a few nice properties of that form. The composition of two cycles that are independent of each other (e.g. \((1,3),(2,5)\)) are already in the proper form if you simply place them in the correct order: \((1,3)(2,5)\). The inverse of a single cycle is always the same cycle reversed: \((1,3,2,5)^{-1}=(5,2,3,1)\).
							</p>
						</section>
						<section id="c_props" data-section-name="Properties">
							<h2>Properties</h2>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Composition in \(S_5\) is NOT commutative in general; however, the main advantage of the cycle form is that it is simple to tell when two compositions are independent of each other and therefore can be commuted. As an example, \((5,3,2)(1,4)=(1,4)(5,3,2)\). Intuitively, it doesn't matter whether you switch elements 4 and 1 first or shift elements 5, 3, and 2 first, since they do not share elements in common.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Additionally, given any (single) cycle \(c\) of length \(n\), \(c^n = ()=\{1,2,3,4,5\}\); so \((1,5)(1,5)=()\), \((1,3,4)(1,3,4)(1,3,4)=()\), and so on.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Inverting the composition of a series of cycles is, thankfully, quite simple. If we have a series of cycles \(\sigma=\sigma_1\sigma_2...\sigma_n\), then we calculate \(\sigma^{-1}=\sigma_n^{-1}...\sigma_2^{-1}\sigma_1^{-1}\). This is especially easy in cycle form, as you simply go right from the last number to the first number, putting parentheses in the same places: \([(1,3)(4,3)(5,1)]^{-1}=[(1,5)(3,4)(3,1)]\).

								For instance, there may be only one communication tape. In this case, digital signatures can be used to authenticate the sender. In case that not all machines may read all communication tapes, Byzantine agreement can be used to simulate the fact that all processors agree on what message machine \(i\) has sent to machine \(j\) at time \(t\). The common clock may be replaced by local clocks that don't drift "too much". The quite tight synchrony of the message delivery can be replaced by a feasible upper bound on the time it takes a message to be delivered, and so on.
