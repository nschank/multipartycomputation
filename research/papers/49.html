						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							<b>Protocols for Secure Computations</b> is a short 1982 research paper by Andrew Yao that is known for defining the Millionaire Problem, and for being the first paper to look into Multiparty Computation. Its results were mostly foundational: only a few very general theorems were offered, all without proof, and the vast majority of the paper is spent describing (the not-then named) Multiparty Computation as a whole, as opposed to defining any particular problems, perspectives, or contexts.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							The main exception to that indefiniteness is the basic problem and protocol he detailed, now commonly known as the Millionaire Problem. Perhaps the most common illustration of multiparty computation, its simplicity and brevity make it an excellent case study into secure two-party computation (as can be seen in the <a href="../../learn/ch1.html#sec1">tutorial page</a> that focuses on it). While Yao mentioned other application cases, some of which were frankly even better candidates for such popularity, the Millionaire Problem nonetheless remains the most common example of multiparty computation to date.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							The significance of this particular paper to this field is difficult to overstate. Despite its shortcomings (namely, its lack of proof and its limited direct application), its focus on defining a general problem as opposed to being limited to a specific one ultimately vaulted it into the realm of influence, and most research into multiparty computation which followed it can be framed within the definitions Yao presented here.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section id="goals">
						<h2>Goals and Results</h2>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							Yao's main goal was to lay the groundwork for later research by outlining the framework of a few different basic types of problems, as well as citing a few basic applications. He defined the problem of multiparty computation in terms of:
						</p>
						<ul class="rp_analysis">
							<li><b>The limitations of privacy and security constraints.</b> Yao cited two extreme examples to display the difference. On the extreme privacy side, he gave the Millionaire Problem as an example, in which it is assumed that no saboteurs are on the line, but in which both parties want the other to learn nothing about their own input. On the extreme security side, he cited any basic encryption/decryption scheme in which a message needs to be sent over an unsecure line from one party to the other. Multiparty Computation protocols can be private, secure, or both, and all in varying degrees.</li>
							<li><b>Deterministic vs. probabilistic computation.</b> Yao mentions that both are possible, though the latter is rather obviously more difficult to prove secure, especially if the probability density of the inputs is not constant.</li>
							<li><b>Number of parties.</b> Yao assumes the two-party case for the majority of the paper, but expands the ideas to any \(m\) parties near his conclusions. The \(m\) party case is generally more difficult to deal with due to <span class="definable" data-define="collusion">collusions</span> that are impossible in the two-party case; however, Yao states that it is possible to create a protocol for any \(m\) parties with any function.</li>
							<li><b>Trust, cheating, and collusion.</b> Parties may not trust that the other parties are following the protocol correctly, and that must be built into some protocols in order to ensure that the results are still viable. Cheating (as opposed to sabotage, below) may affect correctness, privacy, or both. Collusion is a particular subset of cheating under which multiple cheaters work together. Yao states that any computable function \(f\) can be turned into a protocol with an upper-bounded probability of successful cheating.</li>
							<li><b>Sabotage and eavesdropping.</b> Parties may not be able to communicate without interference or eavesdropping by outside parties, affecting correctness, security, or both. Yao mentions these as issues to be discussed elsewhere, but implies them to be as possible to overcome as cheating.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="rp_analysis">
							Yao specifically mentions, as an aside, that his theorems prove that <span class="definable">mental poker</span> can be played with any public-key system, a generalization of previous research.
						</p>

						<h2>Assumptions</h2>
						<p class="rp_analysis">

                                Assume that initially all pairs of \((i,j)\)
                                values are equally likely.
                                Suppose Bob and Alice carry out the computation faithfully according to the protocol.
                                At the end, Alice can in principle, from her computed value \(v\) of the function and the strings in her possession,
                                compute a probability distribution of the values of \(j\);

                            Two millionaires wish to know who is richer; however, they do not want to find out inadvertently any additional information about each other’s wealth. 
                            How can they carry out such a conversation?
                        </p>

                        <p class="rp_original">
                            This is a special case of the following general problem. Suppose \(m\) people wish to compute the value of a function
                            <span class="equation" data-equation="fx1xm">\(f(x_1, x_2, &hellip;, x_m)\)</span>,
                            which is an integer-valued function of \(m\) integer variables \(x_i\) of bounded range.
                            Assume initially person \(P_i\) knows the value of \(x_i\) and no other
                            \(x\)’s. Is it possible for them to compute the value of \(f\), by communicating among themselves, without unduly giving away any information about the values of their own variables?
                            The millionaire’s problem corresponds to the case when \(m = 2\) and
                            \(f(x_1, x_2) = 1\) if \(x_1 &lt; x_2\),
                            and \(0\) otherwise. In this paper, we will give precise formulation of this general problem and describe three ways of solving it by use of <span class="definable" data-define="one-way function">one-way functions</span>. These results have applications to secret voting, private querying of database, oblivious negotiation, playing <span class="definable">mental poker</span>, etc. We will also discuss the complexity question “How many bits need to be exchanged for the computation”, and describe methods to prevent participants from cheating. Finally, we study the question “What cannot be accomplished with one-way functions”.

                            Before describing these results, we would like to put this work in perspective by first considering a unified view of secure computation in the next section.

                        <p class="rp_original">
                            Since <span class="definable" data-define="one-way function">one-way functions</span> were first proposed in 1976 <sup class="reference" data-citation="1"><a href="#citation1">[1]</a></sup>, they have been used in two kinds of applications.

                            The first kind is concerned with the <span class="definable">encryption</span> and transmission of messages to make them unreadable and unalterable for eavesdroppers and saboteurs <sup class="reference" data-citation="1"><a href="#citation1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="2"><a href="#citation2">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="3"><a href="#citation3">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="4"><a href="#citation4">[4]</a></sup>.

                            The second kind of applications includes “<span class="definable">mental poker</span>”<sup class="reference" data-citation="5"><a href="#citation5">[5]</a></sup>, in which two players deal cards by communicating over a telephone line, and “<span class="definable" data-define="coin flip">coin flipping</span>” <sup class="reference" data-citation="6"><a href="#citation6">[6]</a></sup>, in which two mutually suspecting parties are to generate an unbiased bit.

                            It would be desirable to have a unified framework where all these applications can be related, and where common proof techniques can be developed for proving the security of protocols.

                            More fundamentally, such a framework is essential if we are ever to understand the intrinsic power and limitation of one-way functions.

                            For example, without a precise model it would be hard to answer a question such as “Is it possible for three mutually suspecting parties to interactively generate a bit with <span class="definable">bias</span>
                            \(\frac{1}{e}\)?”
                        </p>
						<p class="rp_annotation">
							Yao answers this question in <a href="#theorem7">Theorem 7</a>, which states that <span class="definable">transcendental</span> biases are not achievable <span class="definable" data-define="robust">robustly</span>.

                        <p class="rp_original">
                            In response to this need, we propose to adopt the following view.

                            Two parties Alice and Bob, in possession of private variables \(i\) and \(j\) respectively,
                            wish to communicate so that Alice can evaluate a function \(f(i, j)\), and Bob a function \(g(i, j)\).

                            There may be some eavesdroppers or saboteurs on the communication line.

                            The purpose of a protocol would be to design an algorithm for Alice and Bob to follow, such that certain <span class="definable" data-define="security constraint">security constraints</span> (against saboteur) and <span class="definable" data-define="privacy constraint">privacy constraints</span> (Alice may not wish to reveal the exact value of \(i\)) can be satisfied.
                        </p>
                        <p class="rp_original">
                            In one extreme, when the computation component is trivial, e.g. if \(f\) = constant and \(g(i, j) = i\),
                            then we get the first kind of applications mentioned before, in which the basic concern is eavesdropping and sabotage.

                            In the other extreme, when such external threats can be ignored, but the computation of \(f\) and \(g\) is nontrivial, then we get the problem which is to be studied in this paper.

                            (Mental poker and coin flipping represent a <span class="definable">stochastic</span> version of this problem which will also be discussed.)

                            Note that, although we have used Alice and Bob in the above description, all discussions can be extended to the case of \(m\) parties communicating.

						<p class="rp_annotation">
                            The 'unified view of secure computation' as defined in the above two paragraphs is perhaps the most general useful definition that can be applied to the whole of multiparty computation. 
							In the spirit of that unification, and considering this paper is the formative paper for the field, a slightly reworded version of this very definition is the one used in the tutorials and across the site in order to link specific papers and protocols to the more general problem.

                            It would be natural to discuss these two special cases together.

                            However, due to length consideration, we will report here only the results corresponding to the computation-intense case with no outside saboteurs.

                            Results on the other case will be reported elsewhere.

                                For definiteness, suppose Alice has \(i\) millions and Bob has \(j\) millions,
                                where \(1 \leq i,j \leq 10\).

                                We need a protocol for them to decide whether \(i  &lt;  j\), such that this is also the only thing they know in the end
                                (aside from their own values).

                                Let \(M\) be <span class="equation" data-equation="NbitZ+">the set of all \(N\)-bit nonnegative integers</span>,

                                Let \(E_a\) be the public key of Alice, generated by choosing a random element from \(Q_N\).

							<p class="rp_annotation">
								Firstly, it should be noted that in the original paper, Yao put that \(1 &lt; i,j &lt; 10\); however, the protocol is not at any way affected by allowing \(i\) or \(j\) to be \(1\) or \(10\), and it doing so cuts down on unnecessary bits sent.
								Secondly, beginning readers should note that, while Bob can calculate \(E_a(x)\), he is unable to calculate \(D_a(x)\)&mdash;the decryption of \(E_a(x)\)&mdash; in a reasonable (polynomial) amount of time.

                                    Alice generates a random prime \(p\) of \(N/2\) bits,
                                    and computes the values \(z_u = y_u\pmod{p}\) for all \(u\);

                                    otherwise generates another random prime and repeat the process until all \(z_u\)

							<p class="rp_annotation">
								In this step, Yao made a mistake. The restriction that no two \(z_u\) have a difference less than \(2\) allows Bob to learn something about \(i\) in some cases.
								Let's, for the sake of an example, say that \(i=5\). Alice chooses a \(p\) such that \(z_4 = z_6 + 2\), but their difference is at least \(2\), so this should be okay.
								However, in the next step, she adds \(1\) to all \(z_u\) for \(u \geq 5\); now \(z_4 = z_6 + 1\), which according to this rule is not allowed when initially choosing \(p\). Bob now knows that \(i\in\{5,6\}\):
								those are the only two cases in which \(z_4 = z_6 + 1\) could be possible with the restriction on step 4. Without the restriction, he learns nothing, since all of the numbers are, from his perspective, randomly produced (since the results of \(D_a\) look random to him).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								The above reasoning works for <u>any</u> value that two \(z_u\)'s 'should' be apart, since the addition of \(1\) can always move a \(z_u\) too close to another in the next step.

							<p class="rp_annotation">
								This protocol can be simply altered to calculate \(i\leq j\) instead of \(i&lt;j\) by changing \(z_i\) to \(z_i+1\) (and accordingly changing
								\(\geq\) and \(&lt;\) in the next step to \(&gt;\) and \(\leq\) respectively). The statements \(i&gt;j\) and \(i\geq j\) are the negations of \(i\leq j\) and \(i&lt;j\), so can obviously be calculated the same way but negating the answer.

                                This protocol clearly enables Alice and Bob to decide correctly who is the richer person.
                                To show that it meets the requirement that they cannot get any more information about the wealth of the other party, we need to define a precise model which will be done in <a href="#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>.
                                Here we will informally argue why the requirement is met.

                                Firstly, Alice will not know anything about Bob’s wealth \(j\),
                                except for the constraint on \(j\) implied by the final result that Bob told her,
                                because the only other information coming from Bob is that Bob knows the value of \(D_a(s)\) for
                                some \(s\) between \(k-j+1\) to \(k-j+10\).
                                As the function \(E_a\) is random all the 10 possibilities are equally likely.

                                What does Bob know? He knows \(y_j\)
                                (which is \(x\)) and hence \(z_j\).
                                However, he has no information about the values of other \(z_u\),
                                and by looking at the numbers Alice sent him, he cannot tell if they are \(z_u\)
                                or \(z_u+1\).

                                This has not finished the argument yet, as Alice or Bob might try to figure out the other person’s value by making more calculations.
                                For example, Bob might try to randomly choose a number \(t\) and check if \(E_a(t)=k-j+9\);
                                if he succeeds, he then knows the value \(y_9\) to be \(t\),
                                and knows the value of \(z_9\),
                                which enables him to find out whether \(i \geq 9\).
                                That would be an extra piece of information that Bob is not supposed to find out,
                                if \(i \geq 9\) has been the outcome of the previous conclusion.
                                Thus, one also has to include in the formal definition that not only the participants do not gain information as a result of the exchange specified by the protocol, but also they cannot perform calculation within a reasonable amount of time to gain this information.
                                In the formal definition to be given in <a href="#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>, we will define this precisely.

								This precise example will be addressed in the annotations, because Yao does not return to it. However (spoiler alert), neither party could perform enough calculations to learn something extra in polynomial time.

                            <p class="rp_original">
                                Assume Alice has a public one-way function \(E_a\),
                                whose inverse function \(D_a\) is known only to Alice;
                                similarly Bob has a public \(E_b\), and a private inverse
                                \(D_b\). Assume that \(E_a\) and \(E_b\) are independently and randomly
                                drawn from \(Q_N\), the set of all the possible <span class="definable" data-define="permutation">1-1
                                    onto functions</span> on \(N\)-bit integers.
                                A protocol \(A\) for computing a function \(f(i,j)\) specifies exactly how Alice and
                                Bob should communicate as follows.
                                Alice and Bob send strings to each other alternately.
                                Each time after Bob has finished transmission, Alice examines the information so far in her possession,
                                which consists of some sequence of strings \(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,&hellip;,\alpha_t\), and some relations among the strings (e.g. \(E_b(\alpha_3)=\alpha_9\), \(\alpha_8\) has an odd number of
                                1’s);
                                based on the bits that have so far been transmitted between her and Bob,
                                the protocol specifies how she should compute in private strings \(\alpha_{t+1},\alpha_{t+2},&hellip;,\alpha_s\)
                                where each new string \(\alpha_u\) is a function of the earlier strings,
                                or of the form \(E_a(y)\),
                                \(E_b(y)\) or \(D_a(y)\)
                                where y is a string already obtained.
                                The choice of which function to apply or whether to evaluate \(E_b\) or \(D_a\) is in general
                                probabilistic, i.e. she will decide to evaluate \(E(\alpha_4)\),
                                or to compute \(\alpha_2 + 3\alpha_8\) based on the outcomes of some <span class="definable" data-define="coin flip">coin tosses</span>.
                                After she has finished this computation, she will send a string to Bob, and again the string is chosen probabilistically.
                                Now it is Bob’s turn to compute strings and send a string according to the protocol.
                                We agree that there is a special symbol whose appearance means the end of the execution of the protocol.
                                By that time, the protocol has an instruction for each participant to compute
                                the function value \(f\) in private.
                                Finally, we require that, in a protocol, the total number of evaluations of \(E\)’s
                                and \(D\)’s by Bob and Alice be bounded by <span class="equation" data-equation="O(n^k)">\(O(N^k)\)</span>, where
                                \(k\) is an integer chosen in advance.

								While not mentioned, it is important to note that random (or pseudorandom) number generation must also be allowed, even just for the above millionaire protocol.

                            <p class="rp_definition">
                                Let \(\epsilon,\delta > 0\),
                                and \(f(i,j)\) be a \(0-1\) valued function.

                                Suppose Bob and Alice carry out the computation faithfully according to the protocol.
                                At the end, Alice can in principle, from her computed value \(v\) of the function and the strings in her possession,
                                compute a probability distribution of the values of \(j\);

								Let's quickly see what \(\epsilon\) and \(\delta\) we can apply to the millionaire protocol. For added generality, we will generalize from \(i,j\in\{1,10\}\) to any range of size \(n\) starting at 1. Without loss of generality, assume that Bob has more money (e.g. \(i&lt;j\) and therefore \(f(i,j)=1\)).
								Fixing \(i,j\), we'll first look at what Alice can learn. 
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								Obviously, she knows that \(p_i(x)=0\) for \(x\leq i\). For the remainder of possible \(u=j\)'s, however, she can decrypt \(k-j+u\)'s using her private key, producing \(n-i\) possible \(x\) values. Since \(x\) was chosen randomly, she cannot possibly figure out which one Bob chose. \(G_i=\{i+1,i+2,&hellip;,n\}\) and, with no way of choosing between them, \(p_i(j)=\frac{1}{|G_i|}=\frac{1}{n-i}\) for \(j\in G_i\).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								Bob, conversely, knows that \(i\) must be within \(G_j=\{1,2,&hellip;,j-1\}\). He has slightly more information from Alice, and can try to guess another value of \(y_u\) in order to further restrict \(i\)&mdash;information that would drastically alter his probability distribution. He knows \(p\), the
								random prime Alice has used to \(\bmod{} y_u\), and he knows either \(y_i\pmod{p}\) or \(y_i+1\pmod{p}\) for all of \(i\in G_j\). He must correctly guess a value \(g\) such that \(E_a(g)\) or \(E_a(g+1)\) is \(k+j-u\) for some \(u&lt;j\).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								This is likely why Yao attempted to specify that no two \(y_u\)'s be within 2 of each other, to force Bob's search space \(\bmod{p}\) to be of size \(2(j-1)\). This restriction is not necessary, however: assume the very worst case, which is that \(z_u\) is a sequence of only one number repeated (and noting that that would tell Bob nothing about \(i\) by itself), so Bob has a search space of \(2\bmod{p}\). Since each \(y_u\) could be between 0 and \(2^N-1\), and \(p\) is of maximum size \(2^{\frac{N}{2}}\), this leaves a minimal search space of \(2*\frac{2^N}{2^{N/2}}=2^{\frac{N}{2}+1}\). Since Bob has no extra information which would allow him to choose from the search space better than randomly, finding a single value which would give him any information has runtime \(O(2^N)\). Since this is the minimal search space, it is the best case for Bob, and therefore the probability of him finding any information through extra calculation is <span class="definable">negligible</span>.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_annotation">
								We can set \(\epsilon\) arbitrarily low, since neither party can calculate a probability distribution better than \(\frac{1}{|G|}\).

							<p class="rp_annotation">
								We can calculate \(\delta\) a bit more precisely. The probability of Bob changing his probability distribution is \(\frac{O(N^k)}{2^{N/2+1}}\) best case, so for fixed \(k\) we can set \(\delta\leq \frac{N^k}{2^{N/2+1}}\), which <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+%28N%5Ek%29%2F%282%5E%28N%2F2%2B1%29%29+on+k%3D0..8%2C+N%3D128..256">rapidly</a> approaches \(0\) as \(N\) increases.

                                An interesting question is then to determine the minimum number of bits needed by any
                                protocol to compute \(f\) that satisfies the <span class="definable" data-define="(e,d)-privacy constraint">\((\epsilon,\delta)\)-privacy constraint</span>.
                                Conceivably, there are functions that are easily computable without the privacy requirement,
                                but become infeasible with the extra privacy constraint.
                                Fortunately, we can prove that this is not the case.
                                Let \(A\) be a protocol, let \(T(A)\) denote the maximum number of bits exchanged
                                between Alice and Bob when \(A\) is used.

							<p class="rp_annotation">
								If we set \((\epsilon,\delta)=(1,1)\)&mdash;that is, if we don't require privacy at all&mdash;then the only information that needs to be sent is \(i\) to Bob, followed by \(f(i,j)\) back to Alice, meaning \(T(A)=\log_2{i}+1\leq N+1\); this is the lowest bound possible (\(T(A)\in\Omega(N)\)). This would be increased further by the need for
								security, of course.

                                So far the discussions
                                have assumed that Bob and Alice observe the
                                rules specified by an agreed protocol. What if either of
                                them might cheat in order to gain additional information
                                or to mislead the other party to receive a wrong answer?
                                It is true that with our protocol, any cheating will be discovered
                                if there is a verification stage afterwards where
                                both parties are required to reveal all their private computation.
                                However, that will force both parties to reveal
                                their variables. As will become clear in the applications
                                to be given later, this sometimes can be a serious drawback.
                                The following results will show that one can thwart
                                cheating, without asking either to reveal the variable.

                                Since a protocol can never prohibit Alice (or Bob) from

                                most that a protocol can achieve is to make sure that this
                                is the only cheating that Alice (or Bob) can do.

                            <p class="rp_original">
                                Suppose that Alice is trying to
                                sell Bob a house. In principle, each one has a strategy
                                of negotiation in mind. If we number all the possible
                                strategies of Alice as \(A_1,A_2,&hellip;,A_t\), and those of Bob’
                                as \(B_1,B_2,&hellip;,B_u\), then the outcome (no deal, or sell at
                                \(x\) dollars, . . . ) will be decided once the actual strategies
                                \(A_i, B_j\) used have been determined. Write the outcome
                                as \(f(i, j)\), then it is possible to carry out the negotiation
                                obliviously, in the sense that Alice will not gain any
                                information on Bob’s negotiation tactics except that it is
                                consistent with the outcome, and vice versa.

                            <h4>Private Querying of a Database</h4>
                            <p class="rp_original">
                                The theorems we have
                                proved can be extended to the case when each person
                                \(P_i\) is computing a different function \(f_i\). In particular, Alice
                                may wish to compute a function \(f(i, j)\) and Bob wishes
                                to compute a trivial function \(g(i, j) =\) constant, meaning
                                that Bob will know nothing about \(i\) in the end. If we regard
                                Bob as a database query system with \(j\) the state of
                                the database, and Alice is asking query number \(i\), then
                                Alice can get answer to the query without knowing anything
                                else about the data in it, while the database system
                                does not know what Alice has queried.

                            poker can be played with any general public-key system.
                            It differs from Shamir et. al’s solution<sup class="reference" data-citation="5"><a href="#citation5">[5]</a></sup>
                            in that we do

                            and that we can play it with a public-key system
                            (instead of using private keys). (A solution with a special
                            one-way function with publicized keys for playing mental
                            poker was known in <span class="reference" data-citation="2"><a href="#citation2">[2]</a></span>, but that solution depends on
                            the special properties of the one-way function involved.)
                            Moreover, the present solution uses much fewer bits as
                            the number of cards becomes greater. Suppose we
                            have a deck of \(n\) cards, and Alice and Bob each want
                            to draw a random card from the deck in turn. All the previously
                            known solutions transmit \(cn\) bits of information
                            between Bob and Alice, while our scheme only needs
                            about \(c(\log{n})^2\) bits.

							collude in order to determine the tenth's private variable, the protocol will not make a difference: they need only share those nine values and follow the
