						<h2>Abstract</h2>
						<p class="rp_original">
							A fundamental problem in designing secure multiparty protocols is how to deal with adaptive adversaries (i.e. adversaries that may choose the corrupted parties during the course of the computation), in a setting where the channels are insecure and secure communication is achieved by cryptographic primitives based on the computational limitations of the adversary. 
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							It turns out that the power of an adaptive adversary is greatly affected by the amount of information gathered upon the corruption of a party. This amount of information models the extent to which uncorrupted parties are trusted to carry out instructions that cannot be externally verified, such as erasing records of past configurations. It has been shown that if the parties are trusted to erase such records, then adaptively secure computation can be carried out using known primitives. However, this total trust in parties may be unrealistic in many scenarios. An important question, open since 1986, is whether adaptively secure multiparty computation can be carried out in the 'insecure channel' setting, even if no party is thoroughly trusted.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							Our main result is an affirmative resolution of this question for the case where even uncorrupted parties may deviate from the protocol by keeping record of all past configurations. We first propose a novel property of encryption protocols and show that if an encryption protocol enjoying this property is used, instead of a standard encryption scheme, then known constructions become adaptively secure. Next we construct, based on the standard RSA assumption, an encryption protocol that enjoys this property. 
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							We also consider parties that, even when uncorrupted, may internally deviate from their protocols in arbitrary ways, as long as no external test can detect fault behavior. We show that in this case no non-trivial protocol can be proven adaptively secure using black-box simulation. This holds even if the communication channels are totally secure.

						<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
						<p class="rp_original">
							Consider a set of parties who do not trust each other, nor the channels by which they communicate. Still, the parties wish to correctly compute some common function of their local inputs, while keeping their local data as private as possible. This, in a nutshell, is the problem of secure multiparty computation. The parties' distrust in each other and in the network is usually modeled via an adversary that corrupts some of the parties. Once a party is corrupted it follows the instructions of the adversary. In particular, all the information known to this party becomes known to the adversary.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							An important parameter, which is the focus of this work, is the way in which the corrupted parties are chosen. In the case of <i>non-adaptive</i> adversaries, the set of corrupted parties is arbitrary, but fixed before the computation starts. (Still, the uncorrupted parties do not know the identities of the corrupted parties.) A more general case is where the adversary chooses to corrupt parties during the course of the computation, based on the information gathered so far. We call such adversaries <i>adaptive</i>.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							The difference between adaptive and non-adaptive adversaries may be best demonstrated via an example. Consider the following secret sharing protocol, run in the presence of an adversary that may corrupt \(t=O(n)\) out of the \(n\) parties. <i>A dealer \(D\) chooses at random a small set \(S\) of \(m=\sqrt t\) parties, and shares its secret among the parties using an \(m\)-out-of-\(m\) sharing scheme. In addition, \(D\) publicizes the set \(S\).</i> Intuitively, this scheme lacks in security since \(S\) is public and \(|S|\ll t\). Indeed, an adaptive adversary can easily find \(D\)'s secret, <i>without corrupting \(D\)</i>, by corrupting the parties in \(S\). However, any non-adaptive adversary that does not corrupt \(D\) learns \(D\)'s secret only if \(S\) happens to be identical to the pre-defined set of corrupted parties. This happens only with exponentially small probability. Consequently, this protocol is secure in the presence of non-adaptive adversaries.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							Protocols for securely computing any function, in several computation models, have been known for a while: Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson have shown how to securely compute any function in the <i>computational</i> setting<sup class="reference" data-citation="GMW">[?]</sup>. (In the <i>computational</i> setting, all the communication between the parties is seen by the adversary. All parties, as well as the adversary, are restricted to probabilistic polynomial time). Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson, and independently Chuam, Cr&eacute;peau, and Damg&aring;rd, have shown how to securely compute any function in the <i>secure channels</i> setting<sup class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="CCD">[?]</sup>. (In the <i>secure channels</i> setting the adversary cannot eavesdrop on the communication between uncorrupted parties, and is allowd unlimited computational power.) These constructions can be shown secure in the presence of non-adaptive adversaries. In contrary to folklore beliefs, problems are encountered when attempted to prove <i>adaptive</i> security of protocols, <i>even in the secure channels setting</i>. Additional problems are encountered in the computational setting. Demonstrating, clarifying, and (partially) solving these problems is the focus of this work.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							We first pose the following question: To what extent can uncorrupted parties be trusted to carry out instructions that cannot be externally verified, such as erasing local data, or making random choices? This question is intimately related to the power of an adaptive adversary, in both of the above settings, since the adversary may gather additional information when corrupting parties that have locally deviated from the protocol (say, by not erasing data that is supposed to be erased). If uncorrupted parties are trusted to carry out even unverifiable instructions such as erasing local data, then adaptively secure computation can be carried out using known primitives<sup class="reference" data-citation="F">[?]</sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="BH">[?]</sup>. However, this trust may be unrealistic in many scenarios. We thus consider parties that, even wen uncorrupted, internally deviate slightly from their protocols. We call such parties <i>semi-honest</i>. Several degrees of internal deviation from the protocol are examined with the main focus on parties which follow their protocol with the exception that they keep record of the entire computation. We seek protocols that are secure even in the uncorrupted parties are semi-honest rather than honest.
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							We discuss the problems encountered in the secure channels setting, and state the amount of internal deviation from the protocol under which adaptively secure protocols are known to exist. (In particular, under the conditions the <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span><sup class="reference" data-citation="CCD">[?]</sup> protocols can be proven adaptively secure.)
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							Finally we concentrate on the computational setting, and on semi-honest parties that follow their protocols with the exception that no internal data is ever erased. Is adaptively secure computation possible in this scenario? This question has remained open since the result of <span class="reference" data-citation="GMW">[?]</span> (Even for the case in which the adversary only gather information from corrupted parties and does not make them deviate any further from the protocol).
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							We answer this question in the affirmative. The problems encountered, and our solution, are presented via the following transformation. It is a folklore belief that any secure protocol in the secure channels setting can be transformed into a secure protocol in the computational setting, by encrypting each message using a standard semantically secure encryption scheme. This belief can indeed be turned into a proof, provided that only <i>non-adaptive</i> adversaries are considered. Trying to prove this belief in the presence of adaptive adversaries encounters major difficulties. We show how these difficulties are overcome if a novel encryption protocol is used, instead of standard encryption. We call such encryption protocols <i>non-committing</i> (Standard encryption schemes are not non-committing.)
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							Non-committing encryption can be roughly described as follows. Traditional encryption schemes have the extra property that the ciphertext may serve as a <i>commitment</i> of the sender to the encrypted data. That is, suppose that after seeing the ciphertext, a third party requests the sender to <i>reveal</i> the encrypted data, and show how it was encrypted and decrypted. Using traditional encryption schemes it may be infeasible (or even impossible) for the sender to demonstrate that the encrypted data was any different than what was indeed transmitted. (In fact, many times encryption is explicitly or implicitly used for commitment.) In a <i>non-committing</i> encryption scheme, the ciphertext cannot be used to commit the sender (or the receiver) to the transmitted data. That is, a non-committing encryption protocol allows a simulator to generate <i>dummy ciphertexts</i> that look like genuine ones, and can be later "opened" as encryptions of either 1 or 0, at wish. We note that communication over absolutely secure channels is trivially non-committing, since the third party sees no "ciphertext".
						</p>
						<p class="rp_original">
							We present several constructions of non-committing encryption protocols. All constructions consist of a 'key distribution' stage which is independent of the transmitted data, followed by a single message sent from the sender to the receiver. In our most general construction, based on a primitive called common-domain trapdoor system, the key distribution stage requires participation of all parties (and is valid as long as at least <i>one</i> party remains uncorrupted). We also present two alternative constructions, based on the RSA and the Diffie-Hellman assumptions respectively, where the key distribution stage consists of one message sent fro mthe receiver to the sender.

							<h3>1.1. Related Work</h3>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Independently of our work, Beaver has investigated the problem of converting, in the computational setting, protocols which are adaptively secure against eavesdropping adversaries into protocols adaptively secure against Byzantine adversaries<sup class="reference" data-citation="Be2">[?]</sup>. No protocols adaptively secure against eavesdropping adversaries were known prior to our work, nor are such protocols suggested in <span class="reference" data-citation="Be2">[?]</span>. We believe that the problem of adaptive security retains its difficulty even if only eavesdropping adversaries are considered. Following our work, and motivated by the "Incoercible Voting" Problem, Canetti et. al.<sup class="reference" data-citation="CDNO">[?]</sup> introduced a stronger type of non-committing encryption protocol as well as an implementation of it based on any trapdoor permutation.

							<h3>2.1. Semi-honest Parties</h3>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The problem of adaptively secure computation is intimately related to the following question: To what extend can uncorrupted parties be trusted to carry out instructions that cannot be externally verified, such as erasing local data, or using randomness as instructed? Honest parties internally deviate from their protocol in many real-life scenarios, such as users that keep record of their passwords, stock-market brokers that keep records of their clients' orders, <i>operating systems</i> that "free" old memory instead of erasing it or take periodic snapshots of the memory (for error recovery purposes), and computers that use pseudorandom generators as their source of randomness instead of truly random bits. Consider for example a protocol in which party \(A\) is instructed to choose a random string \(r\) for party \(B\), hand \(r\) to \(B\), and then <i>erase \(r\)</i> from its own memory. Can \(B\) be certain that \(A\) no longer knows \(r\)? Furthermore, can \(A\) now convince a third party (or an adversary that later decides to corrupt \(A\)) that he no longer knows \(r\)?
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								To address this issue we introduce the motion of a <i>semi-honest</i> party. Such a party "appears as honest" (i.e. seems to be following its protocol) from the point of view of an outside observer; however, internally, it may somewhat deviate from the protocol. For instance, a semi-honest party may fail to erase some internal data, or use randomness not as instructed. (However, semi-honest parties do <i>not</i> collaborate.) We wish to have protocols that are secure even when parties are not thoroughly trusted, or in other words when the uncorrupted parties are semi-honest rather than honest. We say that a protocol \(\pi'\) is a <i>semi-honest protocol</i> for a protocol \(\pi\) if a party running \(\pi'\) "appears as" an honest party running \(\pi\). We want the requirements from \(\pi\) to be satisfied <i>even if the uncorrupted parties are running any semi-honest protocol for \(\pi\)</i>. (In the sequel we use the terms 'semi-honest parties' and 'semi-honest protocols' interchangeably.)
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The difference between computations in the presence of totally honest parties and computations in the presence of semi-honest parties becomes evident in the presence of adaptive adversaries. Consider a party just corrupted by the adversary, during the course of the computation. If the party is totally honest, then the adversary will see exactly the data specified in the protocol (in particular, any data that was supposed to be erased will not be seen). If the party is semi-honest, then the adversary may see a great deal of other data, such as all the past random choices of the party and all the messages the party ever received and sent. Therefore, the adversary may be much more powerful in the presence of semi-honest parties. We elaborate on this crucial point in the sequel.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We distinguish three types of semi-honest behavior. The slightest deviation from the protocol is considered to be refraining from erasing data. We call such parties <i>honest-but-non-erasing</i>, or in short <i>non-erasing</i>. Non-erasing behavior is a very simple deviation from the protocol, that is very hard to prevent. Even if the protocol is somehow protected against modifications, it is always possible to add an <i>external</i> device that copies all memory locations accessed by the protocol to a "safe" memory". This way a record of the entire execution is kept. Such an external device requires no understanding of the internal structure or of the behavior of the protocol. Furthermore, failure to erase data may occur even without intention of the honest party (e.g. the operating system examples above).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								A more severe deviation by a semi-honest party consists of executing some arbitrary protocol other than the specified one, with the restriction that no external test can distinguish between such a behavior and a truly honest behavior. We call parties that deviate in this way <i>honest-looking</i>. Honest-looking parties represent "sophisticated" parties that internally deviate from the protocol in an arbitrary way, but are not willing to take any chance that they will <i>ever</i> be uncovered (say, by an unexpected audit). Note that honest-looking parties can do other "harmful" things, on top of not erasing data. For instance, assume that some one-way permutation \(f\,:\,D\stackrel{1-1}{\mapsto}D\) is known to all parties. When instructed to choose a value \(r\) uniformly in \(D\), an honest-looking party can instead choose \(s\) uniformly in \(D\) and let \(r=f(s)\). Thus the party cannot be trusted to <i>not</i> known \(f^{-1}(r)\). (Other, more 'disturbing deviations from the protocol are possible, we elaborate in the sequel.)
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								An even more permissive approach allows a semi-honest party to deviate arbitrarily from the protocol, as long as its behavior appears honest to all other parties <i>executing the protocol</i>. Other external tests, not specified in the protocol, may be able to detect such a party as cheating. We call such semi-honest parties <i>weakly-honest</i>.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The focus of our work is mainly on adaptive security in the presence of non-erasing parties (see <a href="#sec4">Section 4</a>). This coincides with the common interpretation of the problem of adaptive security. To the best of our knowledge, honest-looking and weakly-honest parties were not considered before.

							<h3>2.2. Adaptive Security in the Secure Channels Setting</h3>
							<p class="rp_original">
								Although the emphasis of this paper is on the computational setting, we first present the state of knowledge, and sketch the problems involved, in the secure channels setting. We believe that understanding adaptively secure computation in the computational setting is easier when the secure channels setting is considered first.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The state-of-the-art with respect to adaptive computation in the secure channels setting can be briefly summarized as follows. Adaptively secure protocols for computing any function exist in the presence of non-erasing parties (e.g. <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span><span class="reference" data-citation="CCD">[?]</span>). However, in contrast with popular belief, not every <i>non-adaptively</i> secure protocol is also <i>adaptively</i> secure in the presence of non-erasing parties. Furthermore, current techniques are insufficient for proving adaptive security of any protocol for computing a non-trivial function in the presence of honest-looking parties.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								In order to present the extra difficult in constructing <i>adaptively</i> secure protocols, we roughly sketch the standard definition of secure multiparty computation. (Full definitions appear in <a href="#sec3">Section 3</a>.) Our presentation follows<sup class="reference" data-citation="MR">[?]</sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="Be1">[?]</sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="GwL">[?]</sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="C">[?]</sup>, while incorporating the notion of semi-honest parties in the definition. The definition follows the same outline in the secure channels setting and in the computational settings.
							</p>
							<section id="sec2.2.1">
								<h4>2.2.1. Background: How is Security Defined.</h4>
								<p class="rp_original">
									First an <i>ideal model</i> for secure multiparty computation is formulated. A computation in this ideal model captures "the highest level of security we can expect from a multiparty computation". Next we require that executing a secure protocol \(\pi\) for evaluating some function \(f\) of the parties' inputs in the actual <i>real-life setting</i> is "equivalent" to evaluating \(f\) in the ideal model, where the meaning of this "equivalence" is explained below.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									A computation in the ideal model proceeds as follows. First an <i>ideal-model-adversary</i> chooses to corrupt a set of parties (either adaptively or non-adaptively), learns their input, and possibly modifies it. Next all parties hand their (possibly modified) inputs to an incorruptible <i>trusted party</i>. The trusted party then computes the expected output (i.e. the function value) and hands it back to all parties. At this stage an adaptive adversary can choose to corrupt more parties. Finally the uncorrupted parties output the value received from the trusted party whereas the corrupted parties output some arbitrary function of the information gathered during this computation.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									In the real-life model there exists no trusted party and the parties must interact with one another using some protocol in order to compute any "non-trivial" function. We say that the execution of a protocol \(\pi\) for evaluating \(f\) is "equivalent" to evaluating \(f\) in the ideal model, if for any adversary \(\mathcal A\) in the real-life model, there exists an ideal-model-adversary \(\mathcal S\) that has the same effect on the computation as \(\mathcal A\), <i>even through \(\mathcal S\) operates in the ideal model</i>. That is, on any input, the outputs of the parties after running \(\pi\) in the real-life model in the presence of \(\mathcal A\) should be distributed equally to the outputs of parties evaluating \(f\) in the ideal model in the presence of \(\mathcal S\). Furthermore, this condition should hold <i>for any semi-honest protocol \(\pi'\) for \(\pi\)</i> (according to either of the above notions of semi-honesty).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We require that the complexity of \(\mathcal S\) be comparable to (i.e. polynomial in) the complexity of \(\mathcal A\). This requirement can be motivated as follows. Machine \(\mathcal S\) represents "what could have been learned in the ideal model". Thus, security of a protocol can be interpreted as the following statement: "whatever \(\mathcal A\) can learn in the real-life model, could have been learned in the ideal model <i>within comparable complexity</i>". A much weaker and arguably unsatisfactory notion of security emerges if the complexity of \(\mathcal S\) does not depend on that of \(\mathcal A\). (This holds even in the non-adaptive case.)<sup id="fref1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

								<h4>2.2.2. Problems with Proving Adaptive Security</h4>
								<p class="rp_original">
									A standard construction of an ideal-model-adversary, \(\mathcal S\), operates via block-box interaction with the real-life adversary \(\mathcal A\). More specifically let \(\pi'\) be a semi-honest protocol for \(\pi.\;\mathcal S\) runs the black-box representing \(\mathcal A\) on a simulated interaction with a set of parties running \(\pi'.\;\mathcal S\) corrupts (in the ideal model) the same parties that \(\mathcal A\) corrupts in the simulated interaction, and outputs whatever \(\mathcal A\) outputs. From the point of view of \(\mathcal A\), the interaction simulated by \(\mathcal S\) should be distributed identically to an authentic interaction with parties running \(\pi'\). It is crucial that \(\mathcal S\) be able to run a successful simulation based only on the information available to it in the ideal model, and in particular <i>without knowing the inputs of uncorrupted parties</i>. We restrict our presentation to this methodology of proving security of protocols, where \(\mathcal S\) is restricted to probabilistic polynomial time. We remark that no other proof method is known in this context. In the sequel we often call the ideal-model-adversary \(\mathcal S\) a <i>simulator</i>.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Following the above methodology, the simulator that we construct has to generate simulated messages from the uncorrupted parties to the corrupted parties. In the non-adaptive case set of corrupted parties is fixed and known to the simulator. Thus the simulator can corrupt these parties, in the ideal model, before the simulation starts. In the adaptive case the corrupted parties are chosen by the simulated adversary \(\mathcal A\) as the computation unfolds. Here the simulator corrupts a party, in the ideal model, only when the simulated adversary decides on corrupting that party. Thus the following extra problem is encountered. Consider a currently uncorrupted party \(P\). Since \(\mathcal S\) does not know the input of \(P\), it may not know which messages should be sent by \(P\) to the corrupted parties. Still, \(\mathcal S\) has to generate some <i>dummy messages</i> to be sent by the simulated \(P\) to corrupted parties. When the simulated adversary \(\mathcal A\) later corrupts \(P\) it expects to see \(P\)'s internal data. The simulator should now be able to present internal data for \(P\) that is consistent with \(P\)'s <i>newly-learned input and with the messages previously sent by \(P\)</i>, according to <i>the particular semi-honest protocol \(\pi'\)</i> run by \(P\). It turns out that this can be done for the <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span> protocols for computing any function in the presence of non-erasing parties. Thus, the <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span> protocols are adaptively secure <i>in the presence of non-erasing parties</i>. Recall, however, that not every protocol which is secure against non-adaptive adversaries is also secure against adaptive adversaries (see example in the third paragraph of <a href="#sec1">the Introduction</a>).

								<h4>2.2.3. In Face of Honest-Looking Parties</h4>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Further problems are encountered when honest-looking parties are allowed, as demonstrated by the following example. Consider a protocol \(\beta\) that instructs each party, on private input \(\sigma\), to publicise a uniformly and independently chosen value \(r\) in some domain \(D\) and terminate. \(\beta\) looks "harmless" in the sense that no information on the inputs leaks out. However, consider the following honest-looking variant of \(\beta\). Let \(f_0,f_1\) be a <span class="definable">clawfree</span> pair of permutations over \(D\). Then, on input \(\sigma\in\{0,1\}\), an honest-looking party can 'commit' to its input by publicizing \(f_\sigma(r)\) instead of publicizing \(r\). If this honest-looking variant of \(\beta\) is shown secure via an efficient black-box simulation as described above, then the constructed simulator can be used to find claws between \(f_0\) and \(f_1\). Similar honest-looking variants can be constructed for the <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span><span class="reference" data-citation="CCD">[?]</span> protocols.  Consequently, if clawfree pairs of permutations exist then adaptive security of the <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span><span class="reference" data-citation="CCD">[?]</span> protocols, <i>in the presence of honest-looking parties</i>, cannot be proven via black-box simulation. In fact, such honest-looking variants can be constructed for any "non-trivial" protocol, with similar effects.

							<h3>2.3. Adaptive Security in the Computational Setting</h3>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We sketch the extra difficult encountered in constructing adaptively secure protocols <i>in the computational setting</i>, and outline our solution for non-erasing parties. Consider the following folklore methodology for constructing secure protocols in the computational setting. Start with an adaptively secure protocol \(\pi\) <i>resilient against non-erasing parties in the secure channels setting</i>, and construct a protocol \(\tilde\pi\) by encrypting each message using a standard encryption scheme. We investigate the security of \(\tilde\pi\) <i>in the computational setting</i>.

								<h2>2.3.1. Proving that \(\tilde\pi\) is Non-Adaptively Secure</h2>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We first sketch how \(\tilde\pi\) can be shown <i>non-adaptively</i> secure in the computational setting, assuming that \(\pi\) is non-adaptively secure in the secure channels setting. Let \(\mathcal S\) be the ideal-model-adversary (simulator) associated with \(\pi\) in the secure channels setting. (We assume that \(\mathcal S\) operates via "black-box simulation" of the real-life adversary \(\mathcal A\) as described above.) We wish to construct, in the computational setting, a simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) for \(\tilde\pi\). The simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) operates just like \(\mathcal S\), with two exceptions. First, in the computational setting the real-life adversary expects the messages sent to corrupted parties to be encrypted. Next, the real-life adversary expects to see the ciphertexts sent between uncorrupted parties. (In the secure channels setting the adversary does not see the communication between uncorrupted parties.) \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) will imitate this situation as follows. First each message sent to a corrupted party will be appropriately encrypted. Next, the simulated uncorrupted parties will exchange <i>dummy ciphertexts</i>. (These dummy ciphertexts can be generated as, say, encryptions of the value '0'.) The validity of simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) can be shown to follow, in a straightforward way, from the validity of \(\mathcal S\) and the security of the encryption scheme in use.

								<h4>2.3.2. Problems with Proving Adaptive Security</h4>
								<p class="rp_original">
									When adaptive adversaries are considered, the construction of a simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) in the computational setting encounters the following additional problem. Consider an uncorrupted party \(P\). Since \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) does not know the input of \(P\), it does not know which messages should be sent by \(P\) to other <i>uncorrupted</i> parties.<sup id="fref2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Still, \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) has to generate dummy ciphertexts to be sent by the simulated \(P\) to uncorrupted parties. These dummy ciphertexts are seen by the adaptive adversary. When the adversary later corrupts the simulated \(P\), it expects to see all of \(P\)'s internal data, as specified <i>by the semi-honest protocol \(pi'\)</i>. Certainly, this data may include the cleartexts of all the ciphertexts sent and received by \(P\) in the past, including the random bits used for encryption and decryption, respectively. Thus, it may be the case that some specific dummy ciphertext \(c\) was generated as an encryption of '0', and the simulated \(P\) now needs to "convince" the adversary that \(c\) is in fact an encryption of '1' (or vice versa). This task is impossible if a standard encryption scheme (i.e. an encryption scheme where no ciphertext can be a legal encryption of both '1' and '0') is used.

								<p class="rp_original">
									We remark that Feldman, and independently Beaver and Haber, have suggested to solve this problem as follows<sup class="reference" data-citation="F">[?]</sup><sup class="reference" data-citation="BH">[?]</sup>. Instruct each party to <i>erase</i> (say, at the end of each round) all the information involved with encrypting and decrypting of messages. If the parties indeed erase this data, then the adversary will no longer see, upon corrupting a party, how past messages were encrypted and decrypted. Thus the problem of convincing the adversary in the authenticity of past ciphertexts no longer exists. Consequently, such "erasing" protocols can be shown adaptively secure in the computational setting. However, this approach is clearly not valid in the presence of semi-honest parties. In particular, it is not known whether the <span class="reference" data-citation="F">[?]</span><span class="reference" data-citation="BH">[?]</span> protocols (or any other previous protocols) are secure in the presence of non-erasing parties.

								<h4>2.3.3. Sketch of Our Solution</h4>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We solve this problem by constructing an encryption scheme that serves as an alternative to standard encryption schemes, and enjoys an additional property roughly described as follows. One can efficiently generate dummy ciphertexts that can later be "opened" as encryptions of either '0' or '1', at wish. (Here the word 'ciphertext' is used to denote all the information seen by the adversary during the execution of the protocol.) These dummy ciphertexts are different and yet computationally indistinguishable from the valid encryptions of '0' (or '1') produced in a real communication. We call such encryption protocols <i>non-committing</i>.<sup id="fref3"><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Let \(\mathcal E^{(0)}\) (resp. \(\mathcal E^{(1)}\)) denote the distribution of encryptions of the value 0 (resp. 1) in a public-key encryption scheme. For simplicity, suppose that each of these distributions is generated by applying an efficient deterministic algorithm, denoted \(A^{(0)}\) (resp. \(A^{(1)}\)), to a uniformly selected \(n\)-bit string.<sup id="fref4"><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> In a <i>traditional</i> encryption scheme (with no decryption errors) the supports of \(\mathcal E^{(0)}\) and \(\mathcal E^{(1)}\) are disjoint  (and \(\mathcal E^{(0)},\mathcal E^{(1)}\) are computationally indistinguishable). In a <i>non-committing</i> encryption scheme, the supports of \(\mathcal E^{(0)}\) and \(\mathcal E^{(1)}\) are not disjoint but the probability that an encryption (of either '0' or '1') resides in their intersection, denoted \(I\), is negligible. Thus, decryption errors occur only with negligible probability. However, the simulator can efficiently generate a distribution \(\mathcal E^{amb}\) which assumes values in \(I\) so that this distribution is computationally indistinguishable from both \(\mathcal E^{(0)}\) and \(\mathcal E^{(1)}\).<sup id="fref5"><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> Furthermore, each "ambiguous ciphertext" \(c\in I\) is generated together with two random-looking \(n\)-bit strings, denoted \(r_0\) and \(r_1\), so that \(A^{(0)}(r_0)=A^{(1)}(r_1)=c\). That is, the string \(r_0\) (resp. \(r_1\)) may serve as a witness to the claim that \(c\) is an encryption of '0' (resp. '1'). See <a href="#sec3.4">Section 3.4</a> for a definition of non-committing encryption protocols.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									Using a non-committing encryption protocol, we resolve the simulation problems which were described above. Firstly, when transforming \(\pi\) into \(\tilde\pi\), we replace every bit transmission of \(\pi\) by an invocation of the non-committing encryption protocol. This allows us to generate dummy ciphertexts for messages sent between uncorrupted parties so that at a later stage we can substantiate for each such ciphertext both the claim that it is an encryption of '0' and the claim that it is an encryption of '1'. We stress that although dummy ciphertexts appear with negligible probability in a real execution, they are computationally indistinguishable from a uniformly generated encryption of either '0' or '1'. Thus, using a non-committing encryption protocol, we construct <i>Adaptively secure protocols</i> for computing any (recursive) function <i>in the computational model in the presence of non-erasing parties.</i> Finally, we construct a non-committing encryption protocol based on a primitive called <i>common-domain trapdoor systems</i> (see <a href="#def4.3">Definition 4.3</a>). We also describe two implementations based on the RSA and Diffie-Hellman assumptions respectively. Thus, we get

Although the focus of this work is the computational setting, we state this definition also in the secure channels setting.

							<p class="rp_original">
								Next we define <b>honest-looking</b> protocols. Informally, a party is honest-looking if its behavior is indistinguishable from the behavior of an honest party by any external test.

Let \(\operatorname{COM}_\pi(\vec{x})\) denote the random variable describing \(\operatorname{COM}_\pi(\vec{x}, \vec{r})\) when \(\vec{r}\) is uniformly chosen. For \(n\)-party protocols \(\rho\) and \(\pi\) and an index \(i\in[n]\), let \(\rho_{\operatorname{/}(i,\pi)}\) denote the protocol where party \(P_i\) executes \(pi\) and all the other parties execute \(\rho\).

A computationally unbounded \(t\)-<b>limited real-life adversary</b> may choose to corrupt parties at any point during the computation, based on the information known to the previously corrupted parties, and as long as at most \(t\) parties are corrupted altogether. Once a party is corrupted the current contents of its memory (as determined by the semi-honest protocol \(\pi'\)) becomes available to the adversary. From this point on, the corrupted party follows the instructions of the adversary. Once the computation is completed, each uncorrupted party outputs whatever it has computed to be the function value. Without loss of generality, we use the convention by which the corrupted parties output their entire <b>view</b> on the computation.

								<h4>3.2.4. Black-box Simulation</h4>
								<p class="rp_original">
									In the sequel we use a more restricted notion of equivalence of computations, where the ideal-model adversary is limited to black-box simulation of the real-life setting. That is, for any semi-honest protocol \(\pi'\) for \(\pi\) there should exist an ideal-model adversary \(\mathcal S\) with oracle (or black-box) access to a real-life adversary. This black-box represents the input-output relations of the real-life adversary described above. For concreteness, we present the following description of the "mechanics" of this black-box, representing a real-life adversary. The black-box has a <b>random tape</b>, where the black-box expects to find its random input, and an <b>input-output tape</b>. Once a special <b>start</b> input is given on the input-output tape, the interaction on this tape proceeds in iterations, as follows. Initially, no party is corrupted. In each iteration \(l\), first the black-box expects to receive the information gathered in the \(l\)<sup>th</sup> round. (In the secure channels setting this information consists of the messages sent by the uncorrupted parties to the corrupted parties.) Next black-box outputs the messages to be sent the corrupted parties in the \(l\)<sup>th</sup> round. Next, the black-box may issue several '<b>corrupt</b> \(P_i\)' requests. Such a request should be answered by the internal data of \(P_i\), according to protocol \(\pi'\). Also, from this point on \(P_i\) is corrupted. At the end of the interaction, the <b>output of the real-life adversary</b> is defined as the contents of the random tape succeeded by the history of the contents of the input-output tape during the entire interaction. We let \(\mathcal S^{\mathcal A}\) denote the ideal-model adversary \(\mathcal S\) with black-box access to a real-life adversary \(\mathcal A\).
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									The simulator is restricted to probabilistic polynomial-time (where each invocation of the black-box is counted as one operation).<sup id="fref8"><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> Furthermore, we limit the operation of the simulator as follows. We require that the <b>start</b> message is sent only once, and that no party is corrupted in the ideal model unless a request to corrupt this party is issued by the black-box.
								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									If <a href="#def3.8">Definition 3.8</a> is satisfied by an ideal-model adversary limited to black-box simulation as described above, then we say that \(pi\;t\)-<b>securely computes \(F\) in a simulatable way</b>.

								</p>
								<p class="rp_original">
									We remark that the only purpose of the technical restrictions imposed on the operation of the simulator is to facilitate proving composition theorems (such as <a href="#theorem4.2">Theorem 4.2</a>).

							<h3>3.3. Adaptive Security in the Computational Setting</h3>
							<p class="rp_original">
								We now turn to define adaptively secure multiparty computation in the computational setting.

Furthermore, we introduce a <b>security parameter</b>, determining 'how close' a real-life computation is to a computation in the ideal model. All parties are polynomial also in the security parameter. For simplicity of presentation, we identify the security parameter and the length of the inputs with the number of parties, denoted \(n\).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original">
								The framework of defining adaptively secure multiparty computation in this setting is the same as in the secure channels setting (<a href="#sec3.2">Section 3.2</a>).

Since the real-life adversary is restricted to probabilistic polynomial time, so is the ideal model adversary. The execution of a protocol \(\pi\) in the real-life scenario (of the computational setting), as well as the notation \(\operatorname{EXEC}_{\pi,\mathcal A}(\vec x)\), are the same as in the secure channels setting, with the exception that the real-life adversary sees all the communication between the uncorrupted parties. Needless to say that the ideal model is the same in both settings.

This function is parameterized by two identities of parties (i.e. indices \(s,r\in[n]\)), with the following interpretation. \(\operatorname{BTR}_{s,r}\) describes the secure transmission of a bit from party \(P_s\) (the sender) to party \(P_r\) (the receiver). That is, for \(\vec x=x_1,\dots,x_n\in\{0,1,\perp\}^n\) let $$\operatorname{BTR}_{s,r}(\vec x)_i=\begin{cases} x_s &\text{if }i=r\\\perp &\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ where \(\operatorname{BTR}_{s,r}(\vec x)_i\) is the \(i\)<sup>th</sup> component of the vector \(\operatorname{BTR}_{s,r}(\vec x)\).

In particular, in the case where the simulated adversary corrupts the sender and receiver only after the last communication round, the simulator has to first generate some simulated communication between the parties, without knowing the transmitted bit. (This communication serves as the "dummy ciphertext".) When the sender and/or the receiver are later corrupted, the simulator has to generate internal data that correspond to any required value of the transmitted bit.

								Let \(f\) be an \(n\)-ary function, \(t\lt n\) and \(\pi\) be a protocol that \(t\)-securely computes \(f\) in a simulatable way <b>in the secure channels setting</b>, in the presence of non-erasing parties and adaptive adversaries. Suppose that \(\epsilon_{s,r}\) is a \(t\)-resilient non-committing encryption protocol, resilient to non-erasing parties and adaptive adversaries, for transmission from \(P_s\) to \(P_r\). Let \(\tilde\pi\) be the protocol constructed from \(\pi\) as follows.

							</p>
							<span class="rp_sub_header">Proof (sketch)</span>
							<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
								Let \(\pi'\) be a non-erasing protocol for \(\pi\) and let \(\mathcal S\) be a simulator for \(\pi'\) <i>in the secure channels setting</i>. For simplicity we assume that in protocol \(\pi\), as well as in the interaction generated by \(\mathcal S\), each party sends one bit to each other party in each round. Let \(\delta\) be the (computational model) simulator that corresponds to the non-erasing protocol \(\epsilon'\) for the non-committing encryption protocol \(\epsilon\). Given these two different simulators, we construct a simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) for protocol \(\tilde\pi\) in the computational setting. The simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) will be a modification of \(\mathcal S\) and will use several copies of \(\delta\) as subroutines.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
								Recall that \(\mathcal S\) is supposed to interact with a black box representing a real-life adversary <i>in the secure channels setting</i>. That is, at each round \(\mathcal S\) generates all the messages sent from uncorrupted parties to corrupted parties. Furthermore, whenever the black box decides to corrupt some party \(P\), machine \(\mathcal S\) generates internal data for \(P\) which is consistent with \(P\)'s input and with the messages previously sent by \(P\) to corrupted parties.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
								The simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\), interacts with a black box representing an arbitrary real-life adversary <i>in the computational setting</i>, denoted by \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\). The simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) is identical to \(\mathcal S\) with the exception that for each bit sent in the interaction simulated by \(\mathcal S\), the simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) invokes a copy of \(\delta\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) incorporates the outputs of the various copies of \(\delta\) in its (i.e. \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\)'s) communication with \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\). Likewise, \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) extracts the transmitted bits from the invocations of \(\delta\) corresponding to message transmissions from corrupted parties to uncorrupted ones. (The way \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) handles these invocation will be discussed below.) At this point we stress that \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) is the only adversary that \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) needs to simulate and to this end it "emulates" real life adversaries of its choice for the copies of \(\delta\). In particular, when \(\mathcal S\) asks to corrupt some party \(P\), the simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) corrupts the same party \(P\). When \(\mathcal S\) generates \(P\)'s view <i>in the secure channel setting</i>, \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) will complete this view into \(P\)'s view <i>in the computational setting</i> by using the various copies of \(\delta\).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
								We describe how \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) handles the various copies of \(\delta\). As stated above, \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) emulates a real-life adversary for each copy of \(\delta\) using the communication tapes by which this copy is supposed to interact with its black-box/adversary. The information that \(\delta\) expects to receive from its black box is extracted, in the obvious manner, from the information that \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) receives from \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\). That is, \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) hands \(\delta\) the messages, sent by the corrupted parties, that are relevant to the corresponding invocation of \(\epsilon'\). Furthermore, all the past and current requests for corrupting parties (issued by \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\)) are handed over to \(\delta\). The partial view received from each copy of \(\delta\) is used in the emulation of the corresponding black box (of this \(\delta\) copy) as well as incorporated in the information handed by \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) to \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\). When \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) asks to corrupt some party \(P\), the simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) emulates a 'corrupt \(P\)' request to each copy of \(\delta\) and obtains the internal data of \(P\) in the correspoding sub-protocol \(\epsilon\) which it (i.e. \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\)) hands to \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) (along with the information obtained by \(\mathcal S\)&mdash;the secure channel simulator). Finally, observe that \(\delta=\delta_{s,r}\) (where \(P_s\) and \(P_r\) are the designated sender and receiver) also expects to interact with parties in the ideal model. This interaction consists of issuing 'corrupt' requests and obtaining the internal data (of the ideal model). This interaction is (also) emulated by \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) as follows. Whenever \(\delta\) wishes to corrupt a party \(P\) which is either \(P_s\) or \(P_r\), the simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) finds out which bit, \(\sigma\) was supposed to be sent in this invocation of \(\epsilon'_{r,s}\) and passes \(\sigma\) to \(\delta_{r,s}\). We stress that \(\sigma\) is available to \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) since at this point in time \(P\) has already been corrupted and furthermore \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) (which mimics \(\mathcal S\)) has already obtained \(P\)'s view in the secure channel setting. (Here we use Definitions <a href="#def3.9">3.9</a> and <a href="#def3.10">3.10</a> which guarantee that \(\delta\) corrupts a party only if this party is already corrupted by \(\delta\)'s black box. We also use the fact that \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) is playing \(\delta\)'s black box and is issuing a 'corrupt \(P\)' request only after receiving such a request from \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) and having simulated this corruption as \(\mathcal S\).). In case \(P\) is neither \(P_s\) not \(P_r\) the simulator \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) passes \(\perp\) (as \(P\)'s input) to \(\delta\).
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
								Let \(\tilde\pi'\) be a non-erasing protocol for \(\tilde\pi\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) be as above (i.e. an arbitrary real-life adversary in the computational setting). We claim that \(\tilde{\mathcal S}^\tilde{\mathcal A}\) (i.e. the ideal-model adversary \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) with black box access to \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\)) properly simulates the execution of \(\tilde\pi'\). We need to show that for any adversary \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) and for any input \(\vec x\) we have $$\operatorname{IDEAL}_{f,\tilde{\mathcal S}^\tilde{\mathcal A}}(\vec x)\stackrel{c}{\approx}\operatorname{EXEC}_{\tilde\pi',\tilde{\mathcal A}}(\vec x).$$ Here we present only a rought sketch of the proof of this claim. The plan is to construct a real-life adversary \(\mathcal A\) in the secure channels setting, and prove the following sequence of equalities by which the above claim follows: $$\operatorname{IDEAL}_{f,\tilde{\mathcal S}^\tilde{\mathcal A}}(\vec x)\stackrel{d}{=}\operatorname{IDEAL}_{f,\mathcal{S}^\mathcal{A}}(\vec x)\stackrel{d}{=}\operatorname{EXEC}_{\pi',\mathcal A}(\vec x)\stackrel{c}{\approx}\operatorname{EXEC}_{\pi',\tilde{\mathcal A}}(\vec x).$$ Regardless of what \(\mathcal A\) is, the second equality follows immediately from the hypothesis that \(\mathcal S\) is a simulator for \(\pi'\) (the non-erasing protocol for \(\pi\)) <i>in the secure channels setting</i>. It remains to construct \(\mathcal A\) so that the other two equalities hold.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
								The real-life adversary \(\mathcal A\) of the secure channel setting will operate via a simulation of \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) (the real-life adversary of the computational setting), imitating the simulation carried out by \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\). That is, for each bit communicated by \(\pi\), machines \(\mathcal A\) will invoke a copy of \(\delta\) while emulating an adversary in accordance with \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\). In particular, \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) will be given all ciphertexts sent in the open as well as al internal data of corrupted parties (Regardless if these parties were corrupted before, during, or after the 'real' transmission). Furthermore, when \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) corrupts a party \(P\), machine \(\mathcal A\) corrupts \(P\) and hands \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) the internal data of \(P\), along with the outputs of the relevant copies \(\delta\), just as \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) does. At the end of the computation \(\mathcal A\) outputs whatever \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) outputs (that is, \(\mathcal A\) outputs \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\)'s view of the computation). It folows from the definition of \(\mathcal A\) that the execution of \(\mathcal S\), with black-box access to \(\mathcal A\), is in fact identical to the execution of \(\tilde{\mathcal S}\) with black-box access to \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\). Thus, \(\operatorname{IDEAL}_{f,\tilde{\mathcal S}^\mathcal{A}}(\vec x)\stackrel{d}{=}\operatorname{IDEAL}_{f,\mathcal{S}^\mathcal{A}}(\vec x)\) which establishes the first equality in the previous equation.
							</p>
							<p class="rp_original rp_sub">
								It remains to show that \(\operatorname{EXEC}_{\pi',\mathcal A}(\vec x)\stackrel{c}{\approx}\operatorname{EXEC}_{\tilde\pi',\tilde{\mathcal A}}(\vec x)\). Essentially the difference between these two executions is that \(\operatorname{EXEC}_{\pi',\mathcal A}(\vec x)\) is a real-life execution in the secure channel setting which is augmented by invocation of \(\delta\) (performed by \(\mathcal A\)), whereas \(\operatorname{EXEC}_{\tilde\pi',\tilde{\mathcal A}}(\vec x)\) is a real-life execution in the computational-setting in which honest parties use the encryption protocol \(\epsilon'\). However, the security of \(\epsilon\) means that invocations of \(\delta\) are indistinguishable from executions by \(\epsilon'\) (both in presence of adaptive adversaries). Using induction on the number of rounds, one thus establishes the last equality of the above equation.

The latter are <i>commitment</i> schemes where the recipient of a commitment \(c\) can generate by himself the de-commitments of \(c\) to both 0 and 1, whereas the sender is "effectively committed" to a specific bit value.
					</li>
					<li id="footnote4">
						<a href="#fref4">[^]</a> Each of these algorithms is also given an \(n\)-bit encryption key.
					</li>
					<li id="footnote5">
						<a href="#fref5">[^]</a> Consequently, it must be that \(\mathcal E^{(0)}\) and \(\mathcal E^{(1)}\) are computationally indistinguishable. Thus, a non-committing encryption scheme is also a secure encryption scheme in the traditional sense.

					<li id="footnote6">
						<a href="#fref6">[^]</a> A more general formulation allows different parties to compute a different functions of the input. Specifically, in this case the range of \(f\) is an \(n\)-fold Cartesian product and the interpretation is that the \(i\)<sup>th</sup> party should get the \(i\)<sup>th</sup> component of \(f(\vec{x})\).
					</li>
					<li id="footnote7">
						<a href="#fref7">[^]</a> In the case where each party computes a different function of the inputs, as discussed in the previous footnote, the trusted party will hand each party its specified output.
					</li>
					<li id="footnote8">
						<a href="#fref8">[^]</a> For simplicity, we assume that the computed function is polynomially computable. Alternatively, the simulator is polynomial in the complexity of the function.

					<li id="footnote9">
						<a href="#fref9">[^]</a> For simplicity we assume that the links are authenticated, namely the adversary cannot <i>alter</i> the communication. Authenticity can be achieved via standard primitives.

						<a href="#fref10">[^]</a> A security proof of the <span class="reference" data-citation="BGW">[?]</span> construction can be extracted from <span class="reference" data-citation="C">[?]</span> (chapter 3), which deals with the more involved asynchronous model.
