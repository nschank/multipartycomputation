The administrator is a firm believer in the Open Source Initiative, and all original content (<a href="http://www.github.com/nschank/multipartycomputation">past</a> and present) is freely available for anyone to use for any reason whatsoever. This website does not accept liability for any usage of this information, though if something we said was wrong or misleading, we would love to hear about it <a href="mailto:multipartycomputationorg+generalcorrection@gmail.com">here</a> or using the email address at the bottom of a specific problematic page.

						No licensing has been dealt with as of yet because this site is not done (or even close). In an effort to keep currently-unlicensed research private, this site has been hidden from search engines and the URL is not being announced anywhere. If you own the licensing to any research currently posted, and would like it taken down (even if just temporarily while a license is sought), please contact us <a href="mailto:multipartycomputationorg+copyright@gmail.com">here</a> and it will be taken down immediately.
					</p>

						We do not condone or suggest violating the licenses attached to any non-original work (including research papers, abstracts, or code). Any alterations to those works made during transcription were either accidental, or minor and addressed either directly adjacent to the change or <a href="changes.html">here</a>. These changes are intended to be either cosmetic or due to an actual typo or error (which would be addressed and explained). If a license holder has an issue with this or any change, please contact us <a href="mailto:multipartycomputationorg+copyright@gmail.com">here</a>.
