The exponential increase in sensitive data that needs to be passed upon networked computers and the stupendous growth of internet has precipitated vast opportunities for cooperative computation, where parties come together to facilitate computations and draw out conclusions that are mutually beneficial; at the same time aspiring to keep their private data secure. These computations are generally required to be done between competitors, who are obviously wary of each-others intentions. SMC caters not only to the needs of such parties but also provides plausible solutions to individual organizations for problems like privacy-preserving database query, privacy-preserving scientific computations, privacy-preserving intrusion detection and privacy-preserving data mining. This paper is the second version of a previously proposed protocol Extended_Encrypto_Random, which itself was an extension of the initial work Encrypto_Random. The former endeavors presented a plain sailing yet effective approach to SMC and also laid forward an aptly crafted architecture, whereby such efficient protocols, involving the parties that have come forward for joint-computations and the third party who undertakes such computations, can be developed. Through this succeeding work an attempt has been made to further strengthen the existing protocols, thus paving the way for a more secure multi-party computational process."},

First, we study general two-party secure computation, where two mutually distrustful parties are trying to compute an arbitrary function of their inputs, without revealing any extra information (even if one of them is malicious). We prove that, if any non-trivial function can be so computed, then so can every other function. That is, every non-trivial function is complete for two-party secure computation. Consequently, the complexity assumptions sufficient and/or necessary for securely computing f are the same for every non-trivial function f. Next we study the concrete problem of secure database access, where the privacy of both the database and the use is to be protected from each other and from all other participating or eavesdropping parties. We are interesting in practical and theoretical aspects of this problem, addressing issues of efficiency, security, and complexity. More specifically, we start from the model of private information retrieval (PIR), where users are trying to retrieve information from a database while keeping their queries private from the database owner. We then explore the following directions:<ul><li>We study the necessary assumptions for single server PIR with low communication. We prove that oblivious transfer is necessary, implying that PIR is a complete primitive for secure computation, and that computational SPIR protocols can be efficiently constructed from PIR protocols.</li><li>We introduce the model of SPIR, where the privacy of the data, as well as the user, is guaranteed. We show how to efficiently transform PIR protocols into SPIR protocols, for both the information-theoretic and computation settings.</li><li>We introduce the random server model for PIR, and show how to use it to achieve information theoretic solutions in which the database need not give away its data to be replicated, and with minimal online computation for the database.</li></ul>"},

It turns out that the power of an adaptive adversary is greatly affected by the amount of information gathered upon the corruption of a party. This amount of information models the extent to which uncorrupted parties are trusted to carry out instructions that cannot be externally verified, such as erasing records of past configurations. It has been shown that if the parties are trusted to erase such records, then adaptively secure computation can be carried out using known primitives. However, this total trust in parties may be unrealistic in many scenarios. An important question, open since 1986, is whether adaptively secure multiparty computation can be carried out in the 'insecure channel' setting, even if no party is thoroughly trusted. Our main result is an affirmative resolution of this question for the case where even uncorrupted parties may deviate from the protocol by keeping record of all past configurations. We first propose a novel property of encryption protocols and show that if an encryption protocol enjoying this property is used, instead of a standard encryption scheme, then known constructions become adaptively secure. Next we construct, based on the standard RSA assumption, an encryption protocol that enjoys this property. We also consider parties that, even when uncorrupted, may internally deviate from their protocols in arbitrary ways, as long as no external test can detect fault behavior. We show that in this case no non-trivial protocol can be proven adaptively secure using black-box simulation. This holds even if the communication channels are totally secure.", hasPage:true},

Yao's original protocol is only secure in the presence of semi-honest adversaries. Security against malicious adversaries can be obtained by applying the compiler of Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson (the 'GMW compiler'). However, this approach does not seem to be very practical as it requires using generic zero-knowledge proofs. Our construction is based on applying cut-and-choose techniques to the original circuit and inputs. Security is proved according to the ideal/real simulation paradigm, and the proof is in the standard model (with no random oracle model or common reference string assumptions). The resulting protocol is computationally efficient: the only usage of asymmetric cryptography is for running O(1) oblivious transfers for each input bit (or for each bit of a statistical security parameter, whichever is larger). Our protocol combines techniques from folklore (like cut-and-choose) along with new techniques for efficiently proving consistency of inputs. We remark that a naive implementation of the cut-and-choose technique with Yao's protocol does not yield a secure protocol. This is the first paper to show how to properly implement these techniques, and to provide a full proof of security. Our protocol can also be interpreted as a constant-round black-box reduction of secure two-party computation to oblivious transfer and perfectly-hiding commitments, or a black-box reduction of secure two-party computation to oblivious transfer alone, with a number of rounds which is linear in a statistical security parameter. These two reductions are comparable to Kilian's reduction, which uses OT alone but incurs a number of rounds which is linear in the depth of the circuit [18]."},

Security requirements in conducting e-Auctions are mainly bid privacy, anonymity and public verifiability. Most of the secure protocols concentrate on privacy and anonymity, which are achieved through bidder-resolved multi-party computation, assuming two or more trusted third parties, either through numerous auctioneers or with asymmetric models in which the commercial entity of an auction issuer or registration manager is assumed in addition to the auctioneer. Multi-attribute reverse auctions promise higher market efficiency and effective information exchange. This work extends and uses the existing schemes. This scheme uses scoring function, winner determination in multi-attribute auctions to implement public verifiability. Anonymity is achieved through bidder side pseudonym generation. By results and analysis we say this is very simple and effective scheme. This scheme ensures public verifiability and anonymity in multi-attribute auctions without revelation of the bids received, third parties and complex communications."},

The motivation for our formulation was to improve upperbounds on the efficiency of protocols for secure two-party sampling (which is a form of secure multi-party computation). Our upperbound was based on a monotonicity property of a rate-region (called the assisted residual information region) associated with the assisted common information formulation. In this note we present further results. We explore the connection of assisted common information with the Gray-Wyner system. We show that the assisted residual information region and the Gray-Wyner region are connected by a simple relationship: the assisted residual information region is the increasing hull of the Gray-Wyner region under an affine map. Several known relationships between GK common information and Gray-Wyner system fall out as consequences of this. Quantities which arise in other source coding contexts acquire new interpretations. In previous work we showed that assisted common information can be used to derive upperbounds on the rate at which a pair of parties can {\em securely sample} correlated random variables, given correlated random variables from another distribution. Here we present an example where the bound derived using assisted common information is much better than previously known bounds, and in fact is tight. This example considers correlated random variables defined in terms of standard variants of oblivious transfer, and is interesting on its own as it answers a natural question about these cryptographic primitives."},

Likewise, there is an increased emphasis on performing analytics based on multiple datasets obtained from different data sources. While ensuring security of data and computation outsourced to a third party cloud is in itself challenging, supporting analytics using data distributed across multiple, independent clouds is even further from trivial. In this paper we present CloudMine, a cloud-based service which allows multiple data owners to perform privacy-preserved computation over the joint data using their clouds as delegates. CloudMine protects data privacy with respect to semi-honest data owners and semi-honest clouds. It furthermore ensures the privacy of the computation outputs from the curious clouds. It allows data owners to reliably detect if their cloud delegates have been lazy when carrying out the delegated computation. CloudMine can run as a centralized service on a single cloud, or as a distributed service over multiple, independent clouds. CloudMine supports a set of basic computations that can be used to construct a variety of highly complex, distributed privacy-preserving data analytics. We demonstrate how a simple instance of CloudMine (secure sum service) is used to implement three classical data mining tasks (classification, association rule mining and clustering) in a cloud environment. We experiment with a prototype of the service, the results of which suggest its practicality for supporting privacy-preserving data analytics as a (multi) cloud-based service."},

Consequently the protocol may be implemented with or without a computational assumption, depending on the kind of BC and OT used by the participants. Assuming a Broadcast Channel is also available, we exploit this result to obtain a protocol for Private Multiparty Computation, without making assumptions about a specific number or fraction of participants being honest. We analyze the protocol's efficiency in terms of BCs and OTs performed.

Thus parties can be later coerced by some authority to reveal their private data. Previous work that has pointed this interesting problem out contained only partial treatment. In this work we present the first general and rigorous treatment of the coercion problem in secure computation. First we present a general definition of protocols that provide resilience to coercion. Our definition constitutes a natural extension of the general paradigm used for defining secure multiparty protocols. Next we show that if trapdoor permutations exist then any function can be incoercibly computed (i.e., computed by a protocol that provides resilience to coercion) in the presence of computationally bounded adversaries and only public communication channels. This holds as long as less than half the parties are coerced (or corrupted). In particular, ours are the first incoercible protocols without physical assumptions. Also, our protocols constitute an alternative solution to the recently solved adaptive security problem."},

One of the most fundamental results of information-theoretically secure computation was presented by Ben-Or, Goldwasser and Wigderson (BGW) in 1988. They demonstrated that any n-party functionality can be computed with perfect security, in the private channels model. The most technically challenging part of this result is a protocol for multiplying two shared values, with perfect security in the presence of up to t < n/3 malicious adversaries. In this paper we provide a full specification of the BGW perfect multiplication protocol and prove its security. This includes one new step for the perfect multiplication protocol in the case of n/4 ≤ t < n/3. As in the original BGW protocol, this protocol works whenever the parties hold univariate (Shamir) shares of the input values. In addition, we present a new multiplication protocol that utilizes bivariate secret sharing in order to achieve higher efficiency while maintaining a round complexity that is constant per multiplication.

A major result in this field is: \"any function f that can be computed using polynomial resources can be computed securely using polynomial resources\" (where 'resources' refers to communication and computation). This result follows by a general transformation from any circuit for f to a secure protocol that evaluates f. Although the resources used by protocols resulting from this transformation are polynomial in the circuit size, they are much higher (in general) than those required for an insecure computation of f. We propose a new methodology for designing secure protocols, utilizing the communication complexity tree (or branching program) representation of f. We start with an efficient (insecure) protocol for f and transform it into a secure protocol. In other words, \"any function f that can be computed using communication complexity c can be can be computed securely using communication complexity that is polynomial in c and a security parameter\". We show several simple applications of this new methodology resulting in protocols efficient either in communication or in computation. In particular, we exemplify a protocol for the Millionaires' problem, where two participants want to compare their values but reveal no other information.

Clearly, security in such a setting is what is desired, or even needed, in modern computer networks where many different protocols are executed concurrently. Canetti (FOCS 2001) introduced the notion of universal composability and showed that security under this definition is sufficient for achieving concurrent general composition. However, it is not known whether or not the opposite direction also holds. Our main result is a proof that security under concurrent general composition, when interpreted in the natural way under the simulation paradigm, is equivalent to a variant of universal composability, where the only difference relates to the order of quantifiers in the definition. (In newer versions of universal composability, these variants are equivalent.) An important corollary of this theorem is that existing impossibility results for universal composability (for all its variants) are inherent for definitions that imply security under concurrent general composition, as formulated here. In particular, there are large classes of two-party functionalities for which it is impossible to obtain protocols (in the plain model) that remain secure under concurrent general composition. We stress that the impossibility results obtained are not \"black-box,\" and apply even to non-black-box simulation.

Because an LSSS neither guarantees reconstructability when some shares are false, nor verifiability of a shared value, nor allows for the multiplication of shared values, an LSSS is an apparently much weaker primitive than VSS or MPC. Our approach to secure MPC is generic and applies to both the information-theoretic and the cryptographic setting. The construction is based on 1) a formalization of the special multiplicative property of an LSSS that is needed to perform a multiplication on shared values, 2) an efficient generic construction to obtain from any LSSS a multiplicative LSSS for the same access structure, and 3) an efficient generic construction to build verifiability into every LSSS (always assuming that the adversary structure allows for MPC or VSS at all). The protocols are efficient. In contrast to all previous information-theoretically secure protocols, the field size is not restricted (e.g, to be greater than n).

The relaxation of security is obtained by allowing the ideal-model simulator to run in quasipolynomial (as opposed to polynomial) time. Quasipolynomial simulation suffices to ensure security for most applications of multiparty computation. Furthermore, Lindell (FOCS '03, TCC' 04) recently showed that such a protocol is impossible to obtain under the more standard definition of polynomial-time simulation by an ideal adversary. Our construction is the first such protocol under reasonably standard cryptographic assumptions (i.e., existence of a hash function collection that is collision resistent with respect to circuits of subexponential size, and existence of trapdoor permutations which are secure with respect to circuits of quasi-polynomial size). We introduce a new technique: \"protocol condensing\". That is, taking a protocol that has strong security properties but requires super-polynomial communication and computation, and then transforming it into a protocol with polynomial communication and computation, that still inherits the strong security properties of the original protocol.

Specifically, we show that any protocol that computes the blind signature or oblivious transfer functionalities and remains secure for m concurrent executions, where security is proven via black-box simulation, must have at least m rounds of communication. Our results hold for the plain model, where no trusted setup phase is assumed. While proving our impossibility results, we also show that for many functionalities, security under concurrent self composition (where a single secure protocol is run many times) is actually equivalent to the seemingly more stringent requirement of security under concurrent general composition (where a secure protocol is run concurrently with other arbitrary protocols). This observation has significance beyond the impossibility results that are derived by it for concurrent self composition."},

The issue of complete primitives for the case of two players has been thoroughly studied. However, in the multi-party setting, when there are n > 2 players and t of them are corrupted, the question of what are the simplest complete primitives remained open for t ≥ n/3. (A primitive is called complete if any computation can be carried out by the players having access only to the primitive and local computation.) In this paper we consider this question, and introduce complete primitives of minimal cardinality for secure multiparty computation. The cardinality issue (number of players accessing the primitive) is essential in settings where primitives are implemented by some other means, and the simpler the primitive the easier it is to realize. We show that our primitives are complete and of minimal cardinality possible for most cases."},

The benefits of this protocol include a high degree of conceptual and structural simplicity, low message complexity, and substantial flexibility with respect to input and output value formats. We refer to this new approach as mix and match. While the atomic operations in mix and match are logical operations, rather than full field operations as in previous approaches, the techniques we introduce are nonetheless highly practical for computations involving intensive bitwise manipulation. One application for which mix and match is particularly well suited is that of sealed-bid auctions. Thus, as another contribution in this paper, we present a practical, mix-and-match-based auction protocol that is fully private and non-interactive and may be readily adapted to a wide range of auction strategies."},

We assume a (necessary) \"leak-free\" preprocessing stage. We emphasize that we achieve leakage resilience without weakening the security guarantee of classical MPC. Namely, an adversary who is given leakage on honest parties' states, is guaranteed to learn nothing beyond the input and output values of corrupted parties. This is in contrast with previous works on leakage in the multiparty protocol setting, which weaken the security notion, and only guarantee that a protocol which leaks l bits about the parties' secret states, yields at most l bits of leakage on the parties' private inputs. For some functions, such as voting, such leakage can be detrimental.

We explore how to extend this to multiple parties, using threshold fully homomorphic encryption (TFHE). In such scheme, the parties jointly generate a common FHE public key along with a secret key that is shared among them; they can later cooperatively decrypt ciphertexts without learning anything but the plaintext. We show how to instantiate this approach efficiently, by extending the recent FHE schemes of Brakerski, Gentry and Vaikuntanathan (CRYPTO '11, FOCS '11, ITCS '12) based on the (ring) learning with errors assumption. Our main tool is to exploit the property that such schemes are additively homomorphic over their keys. Using TFHE, we construct simple multiparty computation protocols secure against fully malicious attackers, tolerating any number of corruptions, and providing security in the universal composability framework. Our protocols have the following properties: Low interaction: 3 rounds of interaction given a common random string, or 2 rounds with a public-key infrastructure. Low communication: independent of the function being computed (proportional to just input and output sizes).

For example, the players can compute the average of their incomes in such a way that no player learns the income of any other player. Or, as a more applied example, a set of voters can compute the sum of their votes without revealing any particular vote. The classical results in the literature state that \\(n\\) players can compute any function in such a way that any subset of up to \\(t&lt;n/2\\) players obtains no (zero) information about the other players' inputs, except for what can be derived from the public function output. If the bad players may deviate from the protocol and try both to obtain information about the other players inputs as well as to falsify the public output of the computation, then up to \\(t&lt;n/3\\) can be tolerated. Both bounds are tight. The achievements of this thesis are three-fold: First, we investigate the efficiency of multi-party protocols. Especially those protocols that allow the bad players to deviate from the protocol are very inefficient. We show that protocols that tolerate misbehavior of the players are almost as efficient as protocols that require all players to follow the protocol correctly. The framework that allows this speed-up is generic and might be used for other distributed tasks as well. Second, we generalize the existential results for multi-party computation. We show that one can tolerate certain collusions to be larger than the mentioned threshold \\(t\\), at the cost that some other collusions of size \\(t\\) cannot be tolerated. This models well the fact that in the real-world, some players might be more likely to cheat than others. For various models, we give complete characterizations of the collusions that can be tolerated. Third, we study secret-ballot voting, a particular application of multi-party computation. We are especially interested in the so-called ''receipt-freeness'' property, which essentially means that voters should not be able to sell their right to vote. Receipt-freeness is known to be a subtle property, because one has to deal with voters who are willing to do anything for convincing the vote-buyer that they have submitted the requested vote. We propose a modular framework for such protocols, and construct two concrete receipt-free voting protocols that are more efficient than any receipt-free voting protocol in the literature."},

Our techniques include the use of a data processing inequality for residual information - i.e., the gap between mutual information and Gács-Körner common information, a new information inequality for 3-party protocols, and the idea of distribution switching by which lower bounds computed under certain worst-case scenarios can be shown to apply for the general case. Using these techniques we obtain tight bounds on communication complexity by MPC protocols for various interesting functions. In particular, we show concrete functions that have \"communication-ideal\" protocols, which achieve the minimum communication simultaneously on all links in the network. Also, we obtain the first explicit example of a function that incurs a higher communication cost than the input length in the secure computation model of Feige, Kilian and Naor (1994), who had shown that such functions exist.

This computation should be such that the outputs received by the parties are correctly distributed, and none of the parties learn anything beyond their prescribed output. This encompasses any distributed computing task and includes computations as simple as coin-tossing and broadcast, and as complex as electronic voting, electronic auctions, electronic cash schemes and anonymous transactions. The feasibility (and infeasibility) of multiparty computation has been extensively studied, resulting in a seemingly comprehensive understanding of what can and cannot be securely computed, and under what assumptions. However, most of this research relates only to the stand-alone setting, in which a single set of parties execute a single protocol in isolation. In contrast, in modern network settings, it is usually the case that many parties run many protocol executions. In this thesis, we study the feasibility of secure multi-party computation under this more realistic setting of general composition of protocols and executions. The main results presented are as follows: <ol><li>We show that the basic task of achieving secure broadcast is strictly harder under composition. Specifically, in the stand-alone model, it is known that digital signatures can be used in order to obtain broadcast that is secure for any number of corrupted parties. In contrast, we show that it is impossible to obtain a secure broadcast protocol that composes in parallel or concurrently (even assuming digital signatures), unless one assumes that strictly less than one third of the parties are corrupted.</li><li>The above impossibility result has a serious impact on the composition of secure multi-party protocols (when a third or more of the parties may be corrupted). This is because all known protocols for secure multi-party computation assume a broadcast channel, and implement this channel in a point-to-point network using a protocol for secure broadcast. Therefore, these multi-party protocols do not compose. We bypass this problem as follows. First, we provide a new definition of secure multiparty computation that is a mild relaxation of previous definitions. Next, we show that under this definition, secure computation of any function can be achieved without broadcast by adapting known protocols. As a corollary we obtain secure multiparty protocols that compose (concurrently, when an honest majority is assumed, and in parallel when any number of parties may be corrupted).</li><li>Finally, we study the feasibility of obtaining \"universally composable\" secure multiparty computation. The composition operation considered in the framework of universal composability is very general. In particular, it guarantees that a secure protocol remains secure even when run concurrently with other arbitrary protocols. This captures the security requirements of protocols in real settings (like that of the Internet). Previously, it has been shown that when a majority of the parties are assumed to be honest, universally composable protocols can be constructed from any functionality (in the standard model). It has also been shown that when only a minority of the parties are honest, there are inportant functionalities that cannot be securely realized in a universally composable way in the standard model. Thus, an important open question is whether or nor there exists a reasonable model in which universally composable multiparty computation of general functionalities can be achieved, for an honest minority. We show that in the common reference string model, universally composable protocols exist for any two-party and multiparty functionality and for any number of corrupted parties. This result establishes the feasibility of obtaining secure two-party and multiparty computation (without an honest majority) under the most stringent security definition currently known.</li></ol>"},

To overcome this impossibility, Gordon and Katz (Eurocrypt 2010) suggested a relaxed definition – 1/p-secure computation – which guarantees partial fairness. For two parties, they construct 1/p-secure protocols for functionalities for which the size of either their domain or their range is polynomial (in the security parameter).

Our main result is constructions of 1/p-secure protocols that are resilient against any number of corrupt parties provided that the number of parties is constant and the size of the range of the functionality is at most polynomial (in the security parameter n). If less than 2/3 of the parties are corrupt, the size of the domain is constant, and the functionality is deterministic, then our protocols are efficient even when the number of parties is log log n.

In this notion that we call on-the-fly multiparty computation (MPC), the cloud can non-interactively perform arbitrary, dynamically chosen computations on data belonging to arbitrary sets of users chosen on-the-fly. All user's input data and intermediate results are protected from snooping by the cloud as well as other users. This extends the standard notion of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), where users can only enlist the cloud's help in evaluating functions on their own encrypted data. In on-the-fly MPC, each user is involved only when initially uploading his (encrypted) data to the cloud, and in a final output decryption phase when outputs are revealed; the complexity of both is independent of the function being computed and the total number of users in the system. When users upload their data, they need not decide in advance which function will be computed, nor who they will compute with; they need only retroactively approve the eventually-chosen functions and on whose data the functions were evaluated. This notion is qualitatively the best possible in minimizing interaction, since the users' interaction in the decryption stage is inevitable: we show that removing it would imply generic program obfuscation and is thus impossible. Our contributions are two-fold:<ol><li>We show how on-the-fly MPC can be achieved using a new type of encryption scheme that we call multikey FHE, which is capable of operating on inputs encrypted under multiple, unrelated keys.

We obtain a nearly tight answer to the first question by presenting a perfectly secure protocol which allows n players to evaluate an arithmetic circuit of size s by performing a total of \\(O(s\\log{s}\\log{n}^2)\\) arithmetic operations, plus an additive term which depends (polynomially) on n and the circuit depth, but only logarithmically on s. Thus, for typical large-scale computations whose circuit width is much bigger than their depth and the number of players, the amortized overhead is just polylogarithmic in n and s. The protocol provides perfect security with guaranteed output delivery in the presence of an active, adaptive adversary corrupting a (1/3 − ε) fraction of the players, for an arbitrary constant ε&gt;0 and sufficiently large n. The best previous protocols in this setting could only offer computational security with a computational overhead of poly(k,logn,logs), where k is a computational security parameter, or perfect security with a computational overhead of \\(O(n\\log{n})\\).

Compared with the most efficient private (but non-resilient) protocol, this reduces the price for resilience from \\(O(n^4)\\) to \\(O(n)\\). The new protocol is even a factor of \\(O(n)\\) more efficient than the most efficient protocol for the cryptographic model. The techniques for achieving this substantial speed-up are generic and can be applied to many other distributed protocols, in both cryptographic and unconditional models. The crucial new notion is player elimination: Whenever a fault occurs, this results in the elimination of a set of players guaranteed to contain at least a certain number of cheaters (and possibly some honest players). There is no necessity to agree on which players in the set are the cheaters. Due to the elimination of cheaters, the adversary can slow down the computation of at most t rounds of the protocol, where t denotes the upper bound on the number of cheaters. For protocols of reasonable size (at least\\(\\Omega(t)\\) multiplication gates) this results in a worst-case complexity (when cheating occurs) essentially equal to the best-case complexity (when no cheating occurs).

Indeed, by the same means, one can simulate an arbitrary player in any given protocol. We formally define what it means to simulate a player by a multiparty protocol among a set of (new) players, and we derive the resilience of the new protocol as a function of the resiliences of the original protocol and the protocol used for the simulation. In contrast to all previous protocols that specify the tolerable adversaries by the number of corruptible players (a threshold), we consider general adversaries characterized by an adversary structure, a set of subsets of the player set, where the adversary may corrupt the players of one set in the structure. Recursively applying the simulation technique to standard threshold multiparty protocols results in protocols secure against general adversaries. The classical results in unconditional multiparty computation among a set of n players state that, in the passive model, any adversary that corrupts less than n/2 players can be tolerated, and in the active model, any adversary that corrupts less than n/3 players can be tolerated. Strictly generalizing these results we prove that, in the passive model, every function (more generally, every cooperation specified by involving a trusted party) can be computed securely with respect to a given adversary structure if and only if no two sets in the adversary structure cover the full set of players, and, in the active model, if and only if no three sets cover the full set of players.

In this paper, we construct protocols for the setting of <i>bounded-concurrent self composition</i>, where a (single) secure protocol is run many times concurrently, and there is a predetermined bound on the number of concurrent executions. In short, we show that <i>any</i> two-party functionality can be securely computed under bounded-concurrent self-composition, in the plain model (where the only setup assumption made is that the parties communicate via authenticated channels). Our protocol provides the first feasibility result for general two-party computation in the plain model, <i>for any model of concurrency.</i> All previous protocols assumed a trusted setup phase in order to obtain a common reference string. On the downside, the number of rounds of communication in our protocol is super-linear in the bound on the number of concurrent-executions. However, we believe that our constructions will lead to more efficient protocols for this task."},

In the first, we discuss the task of coin tossing, principally in order to highlight the effect different physical theories have on security in a straightforward manner, but, also, to introduce a new protocol for non-relativistic strong coin tossing. This protocol matches the security of the best protocol known to date while using a conceptually different approach to achieve the task. In the second part variable bias coin tossing is introduced. This is a variant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased coins to toss. It is shown that this can be achieved with unconditional security for a specified range of biases, and with cheat-evident security for any bias. We also discuss two further protocols which are conjectured to be unconditionally secure for any bias. The third section looks at other two-party secure computations for which, prior to our work, protocols and no-go theorems were unknown. We introduce a general model for such computations, and show that, within this model, a wide range of functions are impossible to compute securely. We give explicit cheating attacks for such functions. In the final chapter we discuss the task of expanding a private random string, while dropping the usual assumption that the protocol's user trusts her devices. Instead we assume that all quantum devices are supplied by an arbitrarily malicious adversary. We give two protocols that we conjecture securely perform this task. The first allows a private random string to be expanded by a finite amount, while the second generates an arbitrarily large expansion of such a string."},

All honest parties are required to receive their correct output values, irrespective of how the corrupted parties under the control of the adversary behave. The adversary should not be able to learn anything more about the input values of the honest parties, then what can be inferred from the input and output values of the corrupted parties and structure of the function. Almost all the works that have appeared in the literature so far assume the presence of authenticated channels between the parties. This assumption is far from realistic. Two directions of research have been borne from relaxing this (strong) assumption: (a) The adversary is virtually omnipotent and can control all the communication channels in the network, (b) Only a partially connected topology of authenticated channels is guaranteed and adversary controls a subset of the communication channels in the network. This work introduces a new setting for (unconditional) secure multiparty computation which is an interesting intermediate model with respect to the above well studied models from the literature (by sharing a salient feature from both the above models). We consider the problem of (unconditional) secure multi-party computation when 'some' of the communication channels connecting the parties can be corrupted passively as well as actively. We model communication channels as entities just like parties and consider a few different types of channels, namely fully secure channels, authenticated but eavesdroppable channels, partially tamperable channels and fully tamperable channels. For this setting, some honest parties may be connected to several other honest parties via corrupted channels and may not be able to authentically/privately communicate with them. Such parties may not be assured the canonical guarantees of correctness or privacy. Honest parties which are not guaranteed correctness or privacy properties are called sacrificed, as is done for the notion of almost everywhere secure computation (above model (b)). We present appropriate definitions of security for this new intermediate model of secure computation for the stand alone setting. We show how to adapt protocols for (unconditional) secure multiparty computation to realize the definitions and also argue the tightness of the results achieved by us."},

While the utility of the final result of such interactions outweighs the privacy concerns related to output release, the inputs for such computations are much more sensitive and need to be protected. Secure multiparty computation (MPC) considers the question of constructing computation protocols that reveal nothing more about their inputs than what is inherently leaked by the output. There have  been strong theoretical results that demonstrate that every functionality can be computed securely. However, these protocols remain unused in practical solutions since they introduce efficiency overhead prohibitive for most applications. Generic multiparty computation techniques address homogeneous setups with respect to the resources available to the participants and the adversarial model. On the other hand, realistic scenarios present a wide diversity of heterogeneous environments where different participants have different available resources and different incentives to misbehave and collude. In this thesis we introduce techniques for multiparty computation that focus on heterogeneous settings. We present solutions tailored to address different types of asymmetric constraints and improve the efficiency of existing approaches in these scenarios."},

In this scenario, the trust in other parties should be minimal. In the classic formulation of this problem, most of the parties are trusted to exactly follow the prescribed protocol, except for a limited number of parties that are corrupted by a centralized adversary and are allowed to deviate from the protocol in an arbitrary way. However, an assumption of a totally honest behavior of most parties can not be verified. In particular, if an 'honest-looking' party diverges from its protocol in a way that is indistinguishable from a totally honest player, it can do so with 'impunity'. In this paper, we consider the situation where <i>all parties</i> (even uncorrupted ones) may deviate from their protocol in arbitrary ways, under the sole restriction that most of the parties do not risk being detected by other parties as deviating from the protocol execution. The question whether secure protocols exist in this scenario was raised in the past, and solutions for very limited deviations from the protocol (i.e. refraining from erasing data) were given. Yet solving the general problem was believed hard, if at all possible. Contrary to this belief, we show that if secure communication channels are provided (and one-way functions exist) then any polynomial function can be securely computed in this scenari."},

In particular, we show how the network can securely, efficiently and in constant-round compute determinant, characteristic polynomial, rank, and the solution space of linear systems of equations. Constant round solutions follow for all problems which can be solved by direct application of such linear algebraic methods, such as deciding whether a graph contains a perfect match. If the basic protocols (for shared random values, addition and multiplication) we start from are unconditionally secure, then so are our protocols. Our results offer solutions that are significantly more efficient than previous techniques for secure linear algebra, they work for arbitrary fields and therefore extend the class of functions previously known to be computable in constant round and with unconditional security.

Furthermore we show that the passively secure variant can be modified to be secure when cheating parties are allowed to deviate from the protocol. We show that this can be generalised to computations of n-party polynomials of degree 2 with a threshold of n−1. The threshold achieved is significantly higher than the best known classical threshold, which satisfies the bound t < n/2.

Still, the parties wish to correctly compute some common function of their local inputs, while keeping their local data as private as possible. This, in a nutshell, is the problem of secure multiparty computation. This problem is fundamental in cryptography and in the study of distributed computations. It takes many different forms, depending on the underlying network, on the function to be computed, and on the amount of distrust the parties have in each other and in the network. We study several aspects of secure multiparty computation. We first present new definitions of this problem in various settings. Our definitions draw from previous ideas and formalizations, and incorporate aspects that were previously overlooked. Next we study the problem of dealing with adaptive adversaries. (Adaptive adversaries are adversaries that corrupt parties during the course of the computation, based on the information gathered so far.) We investigate the power of adaptive adversaries in several settings. In particular, we show how to construct adaptively secure protocols for computing any function in a computational setting, where the communication channels can be tapped by the adversary, and secure communication is achieved by cryptographic primitives based on the computational limitations of the adversary. We remark that the problem of dealing with adaptive adversaries in a computational setting was considered to be a hard open problem. Next, we initiate a study of secure multiparty computation in asynchronous networks. We consider a completely asynchronous network where the parties are connected via secure channels. In this setting, we present appropriate definitions and construct protocols for securely computing any function. We present a detailed proof of security of our protocols. In the same asynchronous setting, we apply ideas and techniques of secure multiparty computation to a classical problem in the field of distributed computing, namely the problem of reaching agreement in the presence of Byzantine faults. We present the first asynchronous Byzantine Agreement protocol with optimal resilience (i.e. an adversary may corrupt up to \\(\\lceil\\frac{n}{3}\\rceil-1\\) of the n parties) and polynomial complexity. Finally, we address the problem of maintaining the security of computer systems in the presence of repeated, however transient break-ins. We present a new approach for dealing with this problem. Using our approach, we show how systems can automatically recover from transient break-ins. We introduce mechanisms for maintaining the security of internal data of parties.

In this paper, we provide a complete description of Yao's protocol, along with a rigorous proof of security. Despite the importance of Yao's protocol to the theory of cryptography, and in particular to the field of secure computation, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an explicit proof of security has been published.", include:true},

SPDZ provided various efficiency innovations on both the theoretical and practical sides compared to previous work in the preprocessing model. In this paper we both resolve a number of open problems with SPDZ; and present several theoretical and practical improvements to the protocol. In detail, we start by designing and implementing a covertly secure key generation protocol for obtaining a BGV public key and a shared associated secret key. In prior work this was assumed to be provided by a given setup functionality. Protocols for generating such shared BGV secret keys are likely to be of wider applicability than to the SPDZ protocol alone. We then construct both a covertly and actively secure preprocessing phase, both of which compare favourably with previous work in terms of efficiency and provable security. We also build a new online phase, which solves a major problem of the SPDZ protocol: namely prior to this work preprocessed data could be used for only one function evaluation and then had to be recomputed from scratch for the next evaluation, while our online phase can support reactive functionalities. This improvement comes mainly from the fact that our construction does not require players to reveal the MAC keys to check correctness of MAC'd values. Since our focus is also on practical instantiations, our implementation offloads as much computation as possible into the preprocessing phase, thus resulting in a faster online phase. Moreover, a better analysis of the parameters of the underlying cryptoscheme and a more specific choice of the field where computation is performed allow us to obtain a better optimized implementation. Improvements are also due to the fact that our construction is in the random oracle model, and the practical implementation is multi-threaded.", include:true},

We first propose a framework for fair multiparty computation, within which we formulate a definition of secure and fair protocols. The definitions follows the standard simulation paradigm, but is modified to allow the protocol to depend on the running time of the adversary. In this way, we avoid a well-known impossibility result for fair MPC with corrupted majority; in particular, our definition admits constructions that tolerate up to (n-1) corruptions, where n is the total number of parties. Next, we define a \"commit-prove-fair-open\" functionality and construct an efficient protocol that realizes it, using a new variant of a cryptographic primitive known as 'time-lines.' With this functionality, we show that some of the existing secure MPC protocols can be easily transformed into fair protocols while preserving their security. Putting these results together, we construct efficient, secure MPC protocols that are completely fair even in the presence of corrupted majorities. Further, these protocols remain secure when arbitrarily composed with any protocols, which means, in particular, that they are concurrently-composable and non-malleable. Finally, as an example of our results, we show a very efficient protocol that fairly and securely solves the socialist millionaires' problem."},

Efficient Secure Two-Party Computation with Low Depth Circuits", year:2013, length:8, id:83, abstractText:"Secure two-party computation is a rapidly emerging field of research and enables a large variety of privacy-preserving applications such as mobile social networks or biometric identification. In the late eighties, two different approaches were proposed: Yao's garbled circuits and the protocol of Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW). Since then, research has mostly focused on Yao's garbled circuits as they were believed to yield better efficiency due to their constant round complexity. In this work we give several optimizations for an efficient implementation of the GMW protocol. We show that for semi-honest adversaries the optimized GMW protocol can outperform today's most efficient implementations of Yao's garbled circuits, but highly depends on a low network latency. As a first step to overcome these latency issues, we summarize depth-optimized circuit constructions for various standard tasks. As application scenario we consider privacy-preserving face recognition and show that our optimized framework is up to 100 times faster than previous works even in settings with high network latency.", tags:["Unsorted","Two-Party Computation"]}
