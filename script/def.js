As an example, a full deck of playing cards can be described as {A,2,3,4...K}\\(\times\\){♠, ♥, ♦, ♣}. The Cartesian product is often extended into many dimensions, as in the expression \\(A\\times B\\times C\\times D\\), which would be the set of all ordered quadruples \\((a,b,c,d)\\) that can be formed from an \\(a\in A, b\\in B, c\\in C, d\\in D\\).",

	"NP":"The set of all decision problems which can be verified in time polynomial in the length of the input. More intuitively, it is the set of all questions such that, given a possible answer to the question, we can efficiently determine whether the answer is correct. As an example, the question \"What are the factors of x?\" is in NP because, given a set of factors, we just need to multiply them together to check if we get x. Notice that this is an example of a question that we cannot necessarily <i>solve</i> efficiently, but can still <i>verify</i> efficiently.",
